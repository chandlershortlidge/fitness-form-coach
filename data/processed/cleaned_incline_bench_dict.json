I\u2019m Scott from MuscularStrength.com, and today we\u2019re going to go over the three golden rules for performing a barbell incline bench press. But before we get started, if you\u2019ve been enjoying my Golden Rule series, be sure to smash that like and subscribe button, and let me know which exercise you want to see next down in the comment section below. Alright, guys, golden rule number one: you always want to make sure you\u2019re benching with a grip just outside shoulder width. I know some of you are going to say that with a wider grip you can bench more weight, but when you have a wider grip on this exercise using a barbell, you\u2019re not going to get much of a squeeze at the top of the movement. It should go without saying: the more you bring your hands in, the more of a squeeze you get in your chest\u2014adduction is one of the functions of the chest\u2014which means if you\u2019re feeling that squeeze at the top, you\u2019re going to get more muscle activation, more muscle damage, and more growth, even if you can bench a little more with a wider grip. With a just-outside-shoulder-width grip, you\u2019re also going to have more control over the exercise, and you\u2019ll be able to keep your elbows under your wrists, allowing you to really focus and push through with your triceps as well. Let me show you what I mean. Getting underneath the barbell, place your fingertips on the knurling\u2014I like to use my thumbs, put them right on the end\u2014grab the barbell, lift off, and then as I perform my repetitions, like I just told you guys, I keep my elbows under my wrists, and as I press back up, my elbows stay under my wrists as well. Make sure that as you come down, you don\u2019t flare your elbows out to the side and then push that way. You\u2019re going to lose a lot of power if you do that, and you\u2019re also going to place a lot of unwanted tension on your shoulders. So, golden rule number one: get that just-outside-shoulder-width grip. Golden rule number two is having your shoulder blades retracted and depressed throughout the entire set. The most common thing I notice is many of you will retract, depress, lean back, and get into position, but sometimes the J-hooks are too high on benches in the gym, or in general when we try to press the weight off the J-hooks, we lift the weight and then push it up like this, almost using our shoulders to help us. Once you use your shoulders to help you, you unpack them, and then you start performing your repetitions with your back flat on the bench versus having your shoulder blades retracted and depressed. What starts to happen is you lose a lot of that pushing power, and you also start to transfer more of the exercise into your shoulders versus keeping it all in your chest. If that happens to you, hold the weight above you and reset your shoulders. Once your shoulders are nice and packed, you\u2019ll be able to bench and feel it all in your chest and not in your shoulders at all. You probably saw a clear difference when I benched with my shoulders packed versus with my back flat on the bench. There\u2019s a big difference. The third golden rule is to remember that your lower body and your core are vital to this movement. Yes, it\u2019s an upper body movement\u2014we\u2019re pressing through our chest and our arms\u2014but if your core is loose and your feet are not firmly planted on the ground, then you don\u2019t have a solid foundation to press more weight comfortably. When you\u2019re pressing the weight and lift it off the rack\u2014shoulders packed, bar lifted\u2014you don\u2019t want your feet all over the place. That creates instability, and not the kind you want. You want to be nice and tight: either be on your toes or get your feet flat, push your knees out, arch your back as you push your knees out, then take a breath through your nose and brace your core as hard as you can, squeeze your glutes, and that creates a solid foundation that will allow you to press heavier and heavier weight as you get better with the movement. As soon as you start to feel your core and lower body loosen up, reset yourself. Don\u2019t start pressing repetitions with loose legs and a loose core. One quick bonus tip before I let you guys go: a lot of benches in the gym can be very slippery. If your bench is slippery, your butt will slide up, your core will go soft, and you\u2019ll lose your footing. You can take some bungees and wrap them around the seat, and your butt will stick to these really well. If you\u2019re sliding on the bench, find a few bungees, put them on just like I did here, and that\u2019s going to help you stick much better so that when you\u2019re pressing heavier loads, your butt doesn\u2019t start sliding all the way forward, which can become very dangerous, especially if you\u2019re maxing out or trying to squeeze out those last few repetitions.
