"[Music] when you're learning how to it might be prudent to use a spotter if one is available however if you're working inside a correctly setup power rack a spotter is not absolutely necessary start with an empty bar lie down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up in this position you should be far enough down from the bar meaning toward the foot end of the bench that when you look up your eyes are focused on the down side of the bar your feet should be flat on the ground with your shins approximately vertical your upper back should be flat against the bench with your lower back in an anatomically normal arched position take an overhand grip on the bar your grip should be somewhere between 22 and 24 inches measured between the index fingers this grip width will result in a vertical forearm for most people when the bar is touching the chest at the bottom the bar should rest on the heel of your palm not on the fingers and directly over the bones of the forearm just like the press this grip is best accomplished by pronating your hands with a slight internal rotation of your arms you are now ready to take the bar out of the rack look directly up at the ceiling and push up on the bar locking out your elbows move the bar out to a position directly over the line of your shoulder joints this is the place where the bar is in balance at lockout note carefully the position of the bar against the ceiling this picture is your reference for the path the bar will take as you move it down and up you will lower the bar to your chest touch the chest and then drive the bar right back to the exact position you are looking at on the ceiling overhead stare at the place of the ceiling where the bar is to go do not watch the bar as it moves with the bar locked out over the shoulders have your spotter touch your chest a few inches below the bars vertical position at about the middle of your sternum this tactile cue will quite effectively identify the point on your chest to touch the bar if there is no spotter and your venchik alone inside a rack unlock your elbows and then allow them to drop towards your feet a little on the way down if you do this correctly the net effect will be the same as the spotters touch the bar will contact your sternum a few inches below your clavicles and therefore below your shoulder joints look at the ceiling unlock your elbows lower the bar to your chest touch without stopping and then drive the bar back at the point on the ceiling your eyes have trapped try it for a set of five reps you'll immediately notice that if your eyes don't move from their fixed position the bar will go to the same place every rep do another set of five with the bar reinforcing your eye position and then rack the bar this is done with locked elbows after the last rep is finished should you have a spotter this movement back to the rack should be covered now that we've covered the basic movement pattern for the benchpress we can maximize the efficiency of the lift by improving the position of the upper back legs and feet the upper back needs to be planted firmly against the bench and used as a platform to drive against while the arms drive the bar up when this is done correctly the shoulder blades will be abducted or pinched together sit on the bench in the same position you assumed before lying down to take the bar imagine a hand touching you right between the shoulder blades and imagine pinching the hand between your shoulder blades this pinching will also cause you to raise your chest further contributing to a good position now lie down take the bar out and assume this same position making sure your shoulder blades are pinched together and your chest is up high your goal is to be able to do all your reps without losing this set position against the bench used correctly the legs drive against the floor during the bench press transferring force horizontally along the bench through the hips into the arched back to reinforce the arch and keep the chest in its high position remember that you cannot raise your butt up off of the bench at any time during the mint risk your foot position should be set so that your shins are nearly vertical this position allows for the efficient use of your legs in reinforcing the arch but it doesn't predispose you to bridge your butt up off of the bench the proper position for the feet is flat against the floor so that the heels can be used as the base of the drive up the legs if you're up on your toes you cannot use the force of knee extension nearly as efficiently as you can if your heels are planted for the next sets of five reps add a little weight until the bar speed begins to slow down and your form starts to change stay at that weight for two more sets of five and this is the first work [Music]", "full_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxD321l2svE"}
