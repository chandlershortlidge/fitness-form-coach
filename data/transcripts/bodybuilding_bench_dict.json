Mike Soros and Matt Geary to make my bench press more effective safe and fun before we actually get into talking about the nuts and bolts I want to talk about something a lot of people don't really think about that's equipment now you don't need any equipment other than yourself to bench press but there are certain things that can make your bench press more effective and safe not many people give much thought to Footwear on a bench press but your feet are what connect you to the ground and form your base now footwear is a little bit of personal preference but you want something with a lot of grip personally I like to use squat shoes they have an elevated heel which helps me get my foot flat on the floor and connect with it better they also have really good grip on the bottom and that helps keep my feet from sliding but many people also use wrestling shoes and shoes like Chuck Taylors another piece that really is an equipment but I find to be very useful is chalk by putting chocolate my back it helps we stick to the bench better and form a more stable base to press from the easiest way to apply chalk is to use a partner or lifting buddy have them chalk your back where your back contacts the bench the most important piece of equipment I use on bench press is wrist straps if you're going to create the maximum amount of force you want to be able to keep your wrist in a straight line wrist straps give joint support helping you keep your wrist in a straight line I recommend a good pair of powerlifting wrist straps anywhere from 12 to 36 inches depending on what you prefer many people make the mistake of wrapping their wrists too low you want the wrap to actually cover the joint in fact you want to wrap a little bit above and a little bit below the joint this is why I prefer a bit longer wrist wrap of eighteen to twenty-four inches this ensures I can get enough revolutions to cover both above and below the wrist joint tightness is a little bit of a matter of personal preference I say get them as tight as you can while not causing pain now that we've covered equipment let's talk about what actually makes the components of a good bench press the first thing I want to talk about is foot placement while not as crucial as on squat or deadlift it still is important on bench press it forms your connection to the ground and your base I prefer to keep a flat foot on the ground this ensures I get the best connection possible I also like to keep my back tight and arched to do that I like to keep my feet back as far as I can while still keeping them flat for everyone this is going to be a different position but you want to put them back but not so far back that you can't keep them flat on the floor the next thing I want to talk about is back position as you lie down on the bench you want to position your back in the appropriate position for everyone this may be a little bit different but essentially what you want is to have your back in a position where you're not so far away from the bar that it becomes difficult to unwrap but you're not so far under it that you're likely to hit the pegs when you're pressing I prefer to put the bar right around for head height and this will put my back connection with the bench just below where the bar sits on the rack so now that we're in the proper position I want to talk about back arch now this tends to be a little bit of a controversial topic especially amongst bodybuilders many bodybuilders don't think they should arch they think that an arch is just a powerlifting move but arching your lower back will help keep your spine neutral and protect it while you're pressing it'll also ensure your overall back and stay tighter now if you're not concerned about powerlifting maybe you don't need to arch as much as power lifters but you should still keep a slight arch in your lower back if you're a power lifter then you want to arch as much as you possibly can to minimize the distance the bar has to travel the next thing I want to talk about is gripping the bar you want to grab it tightly and with authority it's gonna activate your central nervous system and get you ready and cue you to stay tight you want to put the bar as far down in your hand as you possibly can if you hold the bar out in your fingers it is more likely to cause your wrist to roll back this means you are no longer pressing with optimal force a straight wrist will be the most optimal way to press so you want to hold the bar as low in your hands as you can grip width is going to be very individual depending on your arm length people with longer arms will probably need to grip wider people with shorter arms can grip more narrow but I don't like exaggerated grips in either direction most people are going to be around the Rings or just a few inches inside the Rings I also don't recommend a false or thumbless grip while they may feel better they are simply more dangerous I've heard numerous stories of people dropping bars on their chest because they use the thumbless grip wrap your thumb around the bar and benchpress more safely the next thing I want to talk about is squeezing your shoulder blades together squeezing your shoulder blades together will allow you to stay tighter it also protects the shoulders what I mean by squeezing shoulder blades together is think about if you had a grape in between your shoulder blades you want to squeeze so tight that you crush that grape just like on squat we want to breathe to create the maximum amount of intraperitoneal pressure so we can brace more effectively and move more weight before you begin the movement you want to take in a deep breath unrack the bar blow that breath out and take in another new deep breath before you start your first rep then you want to hold it and blow out forcefully as you lock out the weight this will enable you to use more weight more effectively one step that gets overlooked is unwrapping the bar just like on squat we want to do this as efficiently as possible and not waste energy the way I like to think about in racking the bar is not to lift the bar off the uprights but I want to think about driving my back against the bench so hard that the bar just comes off you want to take a deep breath brace drive your shoulder blades against the bench and then slowly and in a controlled fashion pull the bar off the uprights now we've gone through a proper set up on bench press let's talk execution after you've unwrapped the bar and you're ready to start your first rep you want to take in a big breath and brace your abdominal wall just like you would on squad or deadlift once you're braced to initiate lowering the bar think about trying to bend the bar into a u this will enable the bar to lower naturally in a good position with your elbows tucked by thinking about bending the bar you're going to naturally engage your lats and tuck your elbows we don't want to flare our elbows excessively on bench press tucking your elbows ensures that you'll engage your lats and press in a more safe and efficient manner another cue that may work is to protect your armpits where you touch the bar on your body is very important and is going to be very different depending on how long your arms are and where you grip one of the most important things for an efficient bench press is to keep your forearm at 90 degrees to the ground if it moves in either direction you're going to be losing energy transfer as you press up with the bar somebody who has long arms and grips narrow is going to have to touch very low on their body if somebody has very short arms and grip very wide they could touch very high and still keep the form at 90 degrees to the ground but as we discussed I don't recommend extreme grips in either direction for most people they're going to hit anywhere from their top ab to their nipple line once you've touched the bar to your chest you want to initiate the upward movement by tightening your glutes and driving your legs in the ground this may seem like a strange cue but just like on squat and deadlift using leg drive is going to enable you to use more weight and stay tighter now on benchpress because our feet are not directly under the bar it's not as important as it is on squats and deadlifts but we're still trying to get every little bit of efficiency that we can out of our movement as you start to press up you want to think about throwing the bar back as you start the lockout process remember we're pressing the bar in an upside-down J path ideally we'd have a completely straight bar path but with most people on benchpress that's not going to be possible if they do the bar ends up too far away from you as you lock out and creates extra torque on your shoulders now that we've talked about how to do a proper benchpress let's talk about some of the most common mistakes I see when people do the movement probably the most common mistake I see is people balancing the bar off their chest not only is this dangerous because the force you create on your sternum but it's almost impossible to stay tight and controlled when you're bouncing the bar off your chest and if you're bouncing it are you really moving the weight another mistake is people don't breathe properly and brace properly if you're not taking a big breath before you start and bracing your abdominal wall correctly it's going to be less safe and you're not going to be able to stay as tight and use as much weight another one of the most common mistakes I see is people flaring their elbows maybe people flare their elbows out because they believe this will lead to more chest recruitment and even if it does it's still not worth the danger this was how I tore my PEC seven years ago by using too wide of a grip and flaring my elbows out it also means you're not going to be able to keep your lats tight and it's going to lead to less efficiency in the movement another big mistake I see is rolling your shoulders forward this tends to go hand-in-hand with flaring elbows out to wine many people tend to roll their shoulders forward as they finish the movement but this is gonna make you stay less tight and has a greater chance of leading to some sort of shoulder injury over the course of your lifting career another mistake that coincides with flaring elbows and rolling shoulders is unlocking your shoulder blades many people will unlock their shoulder blades as they finish a bench press because they feel it will enable them to lock out more weight but that's not the case it will cause you to lose tightness and increase the possibility of injury another mistake I see is people not keeping their feet planet they have what I call floppy feet it usually coincides with all the other cues we've talked about of not staying tight keep your feet planted to the floor this will enable you to stay tighter and press more effectively now you have the tools to benchpress effectively and safely remember lifting weights is a skill just like any other sport and the more times you do it the better you will get at that skill start out with light weight work on your form build it up over time now I know it's a lot to remember there's a lot of cues when it comes to benchpress so go back and watch this video over and over until it makes more sense you may pick up more things every time you watch it also I broken everything down in detail in this article at bodybuilding.com for more articles and videos from me and other great contributors keep
