### Response

Thanks for the clear frame. Based on this single image (so I can’t judge bar speed or exact touch point), here’s what looks off and how to fix it:

What I see that needs work
- Grip safety: It looks like at least the right hand is using a thumbless (“suicide”) grip and the bar is high in the fingers. Your wrists are extended back. 
  - Why it’s a problem: Higher risk of the bar rolling, plus wrist strain and power leak.
  - Fix: Wrap the thumb around the bar. Place the bar lower in the palm (over the heel of the hand, under the index–thumb “meaty” pad). Keep knuckles more vertical and stack wrist directly over elbow.

- Elbow flare: Your upper arms appear flared close to 80–90 degrees to the torso.
  - Why: Increases shoulder stress and shortens the pec/lats’ lever.
  - Fix: Tuck to roughly 45–70 degrees (scapular plane). Think “bend the bar” and “point elbows slightly toward my hips” on the way down.

- Bar path/touch zone: In this frame the bar seems positioned over the upper chest/neck line.
  - Why: Combined with flared elbows, this loads the anterior shoulder and makes you weaker off the chest.
  - Fix: Unrack over the eyes, lower to mid–lower chest (around nipple/1–2 inches below), then press back and up toward the shoulders in a gentle J-curve.

- Upper-back setup: Your shoulders look a bit “tall” rather than pinned.
  - Why: Protracted/elevated shoulders reduce chest engagement and stability.
  - Fix: Before the unrack, pull shoulder blades down and back (pin them to the bench), slight upper-back arch, chest up. Keep that scapular position the whole set.

- Forearm angle: Forearms don’t look vertical under the bar in this snapshot.
  - Why: If elbows are behind or ahead of the bar at the bottom, force isn’t transferred efficiently.
  - Fix: Adjust grip width so that at the bottom (when it touches your chest) your forearms are vertical from the side and from the front.

- Lower-body base: Hard to tell if your heels are fully planted or if you’re getting leg drive.
  - Fix: Plant feet flat, slightly behind knees, push the floor away (“toward your head”) while keeping glutes on the bench to create full-body tension.

Quick checklist for your next set
1) Set your feet and squeeze glutes.
2) Scaps down-and-back, slight arch, chest up.
3) Take a deep breath and brace.
4) Grab the bar in the palm, thumbs wrapped, wrists stacked.
5) Unrack to over your eyes, settle.
6) Lower to mid–lower chest with elbows ~45–70°.
7) Press back and up, keep scapula pinned, maintain leg drive.
8) Exhale near lockout, re-brace for the next rep.

Safety notes
- Use collars and a spotter or safety arms when possible.
- Film from a 45° front corner and a pure side view to confirm elbow angle, bar path, and forearm verticality.

If you share a short video, I can give more precise feedback on touch point, bar speed, and whether you’re losing scapular position mid-rep.
