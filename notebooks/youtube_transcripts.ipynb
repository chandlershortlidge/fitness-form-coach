       " 'transcript': \"[Music] okay welcome everyone to a new episode of technique tuesday this week we're going to be looking at how to perform the overhead barbell press or ohp with perfect technique so with this movement we're performing shoulder flexion basically lifting your arm up overhead which will be handled by the anterior or front deltoid and to a lesser degree the clavicular or upper head of the pecs we'll also be performing elbow extension which will hit all three heads of the triceps and when viewed from the back you can see that there will be scapular upward rotation occurring handled by the upper traps now i like the overhead press for two main reasons first being a basic multi-joint barbell movement it allows for a good deal of progressive overload although it usually does take longer to gain strength on than other exercises so be patient and second it is a great general strength building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion however there is one thing that i don't love about the overhead press and that is that it is quite front deltoid dominant one 2013 study comparing four shoulder press variations found that dumbbell presses were better than barbell presses for targeting the side delts and in both cases doing your presses standing rather than sitting was better for the side belts so if growing the side delt is the main goal in addition to a lateral raise you may want to include a dumbbell press however the range of motion may be cut shorter here especially as you go heavier as the bulky head of the dumbbell might start hitting your shoulders on the way down ending the range of motion so in practice i think it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises and while it isn't perfect on its own i do still like the overhead press as a core sort of bread and butter vertical pressing movement now because the ohp involves multiple joints and uses a large range of motion generally speaking it should be loaded with moderate to heavy weight somewhere in the 5 to 10 rep zone you want to set up the bar in a squat rack at the same height you would for a squat somewhere around armpit height you want to unrack the weight by gripping the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder width grip so your hands are just outside your shoulders get your elbows underneath the bar while slightly bending the knees and hips and stand up straight lifting the bar up off the rack take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with a roughly shoulder width stance and a slight 15 degree foot flare you want to point your elbows slightly outside your shoulders and this will be your starting position now although i wouldn't normally recommend a thumbless so-called suicide grip for anyone new to the movement as you get more comfortable with it i think the thumbless grip can be used here as long as your wrists are stacked meaning from the side position the bar should be resting above the wrist joint not behind the wrist joint near the fingers so you want to externally rotate your shoulders pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45 degree angle you don't want them flared too much out to the sides which can cause shoulder pain and you don't want them straight in front of the shoulders which will limit your strength potential so with the bar resting on your upper chest or collarbone area you want to flex your glutes to ensure that your spine is kept neutral and take a deep breath into your gut pressing the air out against your belt if you have one which is going to increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity as you press while holding your breath press the bar straight up not up and forward or up and backward so when viewed from the side the bar should be traveling up in a pretty much straight line so in order to keep the bar from hitting your chin you'll have to slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press then as you clear your face push your head forward back to a neutral position now throughout the concentric you want to keep your knees hips and shoulder blades motionless the common error here is to shrug your shoulders up to initiate the concentric off the chest and while this may make the movement easier in the short term i think in the long term it really can weaken your bottom end concentric pressing ability and end up limiting your true max strength potential press the bar all the way up until your elbows lock out with the bar overhead centered over the shoulder joint at the end of the range of motion there should be a pretty much a straight line connecting the barbell the shoulders the hips and the middle of the foot this will keep everything in balance and prevent you from shifting your weight excessively forward onto your toes or backward onto your heels everything should be balanced directly over the middle of the foot start the eccentric by dropping your elbows down and to the side at a 45 degree angle so not straight down in front of your delts allow the bar to come to a full and complete stop here while you take in another full breath of air and begin another rep now of course i think both the seated and the standing dumbbell shoulder press make for reasonable alternatives or additions here since including isolateral movements can help prevent muscle imbalances and asymmetries the seated variation will allow for the use of heavier loads however the standing variation will increase stabilization demands meaning more core and side delt activation and unlike with the barbell press here you can just press the dumbbells straight up with the dumbbells more out to the sides since you don't need to worry about smashing your face on the way up for the dumbbell variations i prefer slightly higher reps usually in the 8 to 15 rep zone um so i would say the most common error that i see here is just not using a full range of motion similar to the pull-up many people will cut the range of motion short at the top and the bottom not going to full lockout and also not touching the chest at the bottom keeping your range of motion consistent will ensure you're actually gaining strength through progressive overload not progressive decreases in range of motion and although not inherently problematic or injurious i am going to consider doing touch and go reps as another error here since they're going to create more inconsistent reps and often lead to bouncy reps with lots of momentum and the reliance on that stretch reflex at the bottom and if any of this gets too excessive i think it really can hinder your true brute pressing strength required to get that bar moving from a dead stop and a third error that i see here all the time is not flexing the glutes like i said the goal of this exercise is to press the bar as vertically as you comfortably can and keeping your glutes waxed will usually result in the hips being back behind the bar which reduces stability and more often than not results in the bar being pressed forward rather than straight up and this is a bad habit and it can put a lot of strain on your lower back and create more inconsistency in both your bar path and just form in general okay so that's all that i have for the overhead press guys now before you click out of this one i've just got a quick rundown of what i have planned for the next few technique tuesday episodes um you guys may have noticed that i've been skipping leg day so far in the series so what i'm going to do is for the next three episodes we're going to hit three different lower body exercises starting with the squat next week and i should say here that there is no real underlying method or meaning to the order in which i'm covering these exercises i'm obviously trying to focus on exercises that i think are smart to include in your program but i'm trying to space out the more time-consuming and longer videos like the squat bench press and deadlift so i don't burn out too quickly on the production from the beginning um so anyway all those videos are all coming and i have the whole series mapped out until about mid-june as of now so for the release of the first shoulder related video here i'm going to be offering my men and women's shoulder hypertrophy training program or training manual at 50 off um so for this week you can get it for 9.99 you can find these at the discounted rate for the next week on my website jeffnipper.com or by clicking the first link in the description now so guys don't forget to leave me a like on the video if you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe so that you don't miss future technique tuesday episodes and i'll see you guys all here next tuesday for the squat\",\n",

       " 'transcript': \"okay welcome everyone to a new episode of technique tuesday this week we're going to be looking at how to perform the squat with perfect technique the back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises and even the king of all exercises and that's an appointment i think it actually deserves before we jump into the technique for this exercise let's take a look at what muscles we're going to be targeting with this movement first so with the squat we're training simultaneous hip extension where the hips straighten out on the way up and knee extension where the knees straighten out the hip extension component will be handled primarily by the glutes getting some assistance from the adductor magnus and even though the hamstrings can perform hip extension they actually don't contribute much to the squat at all because of the bent knee meaning their muscle length doesn't change much throughout the range of motion the knee extension component will be handled by the quadriceps and we'll be performing an isometric lumbar extension contraction which will be handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back now another very common misconception is that the abs are highly active in the squat but that simply isn't true emg data shows low abdominal activity in the squat which makes sense given that their function is spinal flexion and anti-extension neither of which occur in the squat so we're mainly looking at the glutes quads and spinal erectors as the muscular targets of the squat and because the squat involves in multiple joints and large muscle masses it's very conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep zone while there are exceptions doing squats for greater than 10 reps or so will usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature leading to sloppy form worse strength gains and lower muscle activation now generally i recommend loading the squat with at least seventy percent of your one rep max or in the five to ten rep zone if your goal is primarily hypertrophy and the three to six rep zone if your goal is primarily strength and again there will be exceptions to this i know it's important to be very objective about where your form stands and possibly consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique and then you can build your way back up to your previous loads with good form a few months of not going as heavy as possible will be far better than taking a few months off due to an injury from lifting beyond your capability before approaching the bar do a quick check to make sure you have the right weight on both sides and that the bar is centered in the rack you want to position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar you aren't hitting the j hooks during the walk out and for most bar positions around armpit height will be a good height for reasons i've discussed in another video which i'll link below i think people actually exaggerate the practical difference between a high bar squat with the bar resting up on your traps and a low bar squat with the bar resting down on your rear delts research shows that ultimately the high bar squat may be a bit more quad dominant and the low bar squat may be a bit more hip dominant now in my experience i think the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and tends to feel a bit more comfortable for many people so we'll be squatting with the high bar position here now the bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward and it's too low if it feels like it's going to slide down your back you want to position your hands as comfortably close to your shoulders as possible as a closer grip here will activate the muscles of the upper back better leading to a more stable base of support for the bar your hands should merely be stabilizing the bar keeping it mashed between your palms and your upper back so you shouldn't be actively gripping the bar like you would in a bench press and just let it really sit and settle in there on your upper back so with both feet underneath the bar you want to push your hips forward to unrack the bar and don't make the common mistake of squatting the bar up with your knees as this will cause unnecessary quad fatigue before the actual lift itself and can contribute to knee pain you want to take three steps backward one small step with your non-dominant leg one medium step with the other leg and then a third mini step to get your feet even once your feet are set they should be planted with about a 15 to 30 degree foot flare in general you just want to make sure that your feet are at least wider than shoulder width now that you've got the squat set up it's time to actually execute the lift and we're going to split this up into three distinct phases brace descend and lift so for the bracing phase your heel and big toe should be making even pressure on the ground and your weight should be centered on the middle of your foot i don't really like the cue to keep your weight on your heels since it can throw your balance off and cause your hips to shoot up early you really want to have your weight evenly distributed across the entire foot your head should be slightly extended with your eyes gazing straight ahead and your elbows should be pointing slightly back so try not to position them directly under the bar which can lead to elbow pain you want to pull a huge breath of air deep into your diaphragm pushing your gut out against your belt to create a solid rigid column down your spine now you're fully braced and ready to begin the descent now for the high bar position you want to break at the hips and the knees at the same time so just looking at the knees first here you want to push your knees forward and slightly out so that they track in the same direction as your toes while at the same time sitting your hips straight down you should be pushing through your heel big toe and pinky toe throughout the eccentric keeping an even weight distribution through your feet and when viewed from the side the bar path should be a perfectly straight line moving straight down centered directly over the middle of the foot you want to lower the bar under control actively driving your upper back into the bar and not allowing your chest to fall forward you don't want to descend excessively slowly to the point where you start to lose gas too early generally you only want about one second negative on the squad now when it comes to squat depth i recommend at least squatting parallel to the ground as a minimum standard for hypertrophy and general strength however for regulation technique you technically do need to get the hip crease below the knee joint meaning you will have to go below parallel and i think most people should be able to squat to this depth when using a high bar position and with the appropriate stance width for particular skeleton and mobility so this position is what we call being in the hole unless you're doing paused squats as a specific training drill you generally don't want to pause in the hole at all but rather take advantage of the stretch reflex at the bottom and then immediately reverse the motion the second you hit depth and although you do want to maintain an erect upright posture during the positive i'm not a big fan of the chest up cue myself since it can cause some trainees to lean too far backward i prefer to think about driving your back up into the bar while keeping your head slightly up which is gonna pull the spine into a good lifting position now remember that with the squat we're trying to move heavy weight and maximize our strength potential so don't worry about squeezing any muscles or feeling the burn or anything like that and you want to explode out of the hole as if you were trying to jump through the ceiling i personally keep my breath held until about two-thirds of the way up at which point i exhale and once i'm back up to the top i'll begin the bracing phase again take another deep breath in and then repeat for however many reps my program calls for now because there are so many errors with the squat i may have to just do another video on just the mistakes alone i did actually do one myth bust video explaining why you should actually let your knees come forward past the toes and why the cue to keep your knees behind the toes can actually be harmful to the lower back and i'll link that in the description below now but other than that i would say one really common error that i see is knee valgus or having the knees cave in either on the negative or the positive this usually stems from lack of proper hip external rotation so you want to make sure your feet are adequately flared out which will help then you want to actively think about driving your knees out in the direction of your toes but not excessively beyond the direction of your toes and simply placing a mini band or hip circle around your knees can help to cue for this and strengthen the hip abductors and wearing a heeled squat shoe can also help harrison's foot pronation or losing your arch is a known contributor to knee valves the other two common errors usually come as a two-for-one deal here going too heavy and not going deep enough because the squad unlike say the deadlift starts with the eccentric phase so it's so much easier to cheat by loading up the bar with more weight than you can handle and then only going halfway down now whereas on the deadlift if you can't lift the weight then it just stays where it is on the ground so it's a little bit harder to cheat on that one now you also want to be careful with butt wink or lower back rounding here and if your back is excessively rounding on the squat you may want to start cutting your depth a bit shorter or just modify your stance width either more or less wide but i think that some degree of butt wink is basically an inevitability for many lifters and isn't a cause for too much concern especially if it's mild and isn't causing any pain or discomfort foam rolling and dynamic stretching before squatting will also increase joint range of motion acutely and may help reduce butt link as you hit depth so if you can't squat due to injury which i think really is the only reason you shouldn't be squatting the first thing i'd recommend is some kind of machine or hack squat or even a smith machine squat if you find that to be more comfortable lunges are great as well but won't have that same overloading potential as the squat wheel and as a last resort i'd say a leg press plus a lower back extension captures a decent amount of what the squad is training okay so that is all that i have for the squat before you guys click out of the video just yet i want to let you know i just launched a new squat program on my website it's a 10 week program and it has some squat variation hit four times per week with volume tapering down to a new one rep max test in week 10. and i would say that if you've been trying to get your squat up there's absolutely no way that this program won't increase your squat max i would say if you do run it for the 10 weeks and you don't set a new pr just send me an email and i'll send you a full refund for the program and i'm actually launching this program for just 12.99 for this week and it's going to go up to 19.99 after that so to give you some idea here this is week one day one so you have all the squat work and then all the lower body accessory work programmed in for you plus coaching notes from me but the upper body work is flexible so you should be able to really easily fit this squat routine into your current routine and i do give some guidance on how you can set that up with different splits so anyway you guys can learn more about that if you're interested on jeffnipper.com and like i said it'll be 35 off up until next tuesday only so if you're wanting to grab it take your squat to the next level you can check that out at the first link in the description thank you guys so much for watching the video i really appreciate it uh leave me a like if you enjoyed the video don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss future tech tuesday episodes and i'll see you guys all here next tuesday for the\",\n",
