A practical start is pinkies on the bar’s outer rings (moderate). Adjust 1–2 finger-widths wider/narrower based on the checkpoints below.\\n- Thumb: Use a full, wrapped grip (thumb around the bar) for safety.\\n- Hand placement: Sit the bar low in your palm (toward the base of the thumb), not in the fingers. Knuckles toward the ceiling.\\n- Wrist: Stack wrist directly over the elbow at the bottom; minimal backward bend.\\n\\nForm checkpoints (film from front and side if possible)\\n- Bottom position: Forearms should be vertical when the bar touches the lower chest/upper sternum. If forearms angle in, you’re too wide; if they angle out, you’re too narrow.\\n- Elbow angle: About 45–70 degrees from your torso (not flared straight out).\\n- Bar path: Down to lower chest/sternum, up toward shoulder line (slight J-curve).\\n- Symmetry: Use the knurl rings to mirror your hand placement left/right.\\n\\nAdjust for your goal and body\\n- Max strength: Go as wide as you can while keeping shoulders comfortable and forearms vertical at the bottom (often index–middle fingers on the rings for many lifters).\\n- Chest hypertrophy: Moderate-to-wide (pinkies to middle fingers on the rings), elbows 60–75 degrees from torso, full range of motion.\\n- Triceps emphasis/shoulder-friendly: Slightly narrower (1–2 finger-widths inside where you started), elbows tucked a bit more.\\n\\nCommon mistakes\\n- “Suicide” grip (thumb not wrapped) — higher risk of bar slip.\\n- Bar too high in the hand causing excessive wrist bend.\\n- Way too wide (elbows flared, shoulder irritation) or too narrow (excess triceps limit, forearms not vertical).\\n\\nQuick setup routine\\n1) Set your shoulder blades down and back on the bench.\\n2) Choose a starting width (pinkies on rings).\\n3) Unrack, lower to sternum, pause briefly.\\n4) Check forearms/wrists; adjust width by 1 finger-width at a time until vertical at the bottom with stacked wrists.\\n\\nIf you share a front and side photo/video of your bottom position, I’ll pinpoint your ideal width and any tweaks to your hand/wrist setup.'"

       "'You’re seeing a thumbless/“false” grip. The thumb doesn’t wrap around the bar; the bar sits across the palm with the thumb on the same side as the fingers. Some lifters also use a “bulldog” variant where the bar is set very low in the palm with the wrist stacked; this can be done with the thumb wrapped or thumbless.\\n\\nShould you try it?\\n- My default: No for bench. A full, wrapped grip is safer and just as strong for most lifters.\\n- Risks: With thumbless bench the bar can roll out if it drifts into your fingers, you lose some tactile control, and many federations don’t allow it in competition. The risk spikes when you’re fatigued, sweaty, or using a thick/slippery bar.\\n- Possible reason people use it: It can reduce wrist extension and feel better on wrists if they’ve been loading the bar too high in the hand. But you can usually fix that without going thumbless.\\n\\nSafer alternatives that give the same benefits\\n- Use a wrapped “bulldog” grip:\\n  - Place the bar low in your palm near the base of the thumb (below the callus line), not in the fingers.\\n  - Slightly rotate your hands in so your knuckles face up and in.\\n  - Wrap the thumb and actively squeeze the pinky/ring fingers to keep the bar seated.\\n  - Keep wrists stacked over elbows with minimal backward bend; wrist wraps can help.\\n- Check width so forearms are vertical at the bottom.\\n- Chalk/dry hands and use a bar with decent knurling.\\n\\nIf you still want to experiment with a thumbless grip\\n- Only with light loads at first, and only with safeties set 1–2 inches below chest height or a reliable spotter.\\n- Chalk hands, avoid fat bars, and don’t bench alone.\\n- Seat the bar deep in the palm, keep it from creeping into the fingers, and maintain your usual bar path (lower sternum to shoulder line).\\n\\nIf you can share a front and side photo of your bottom position, I’ll pinpoint your wrist angle and show you exactly how to set a low, stacked grip that protects your wrists without losing the thumb wrap.'"

Shins vertical to slightly angled back at the bottom. This lets you drive back toward your head without your butt popping up.\\n- Contact: Full “tripod” on each foot—big toe, little toe, and heel glued to the floor the entire set.\\n- Direction of force: Push the floor away/back toward your head to wedge your shoulders harder into the bench, not straight up.\\n\\nSimple setup (30 seconds)\\n1) Set your shoulder blades down and back.\\n2) Plant feet where you can keep full tripod contact; angle them slightly behind your knees.\\n3) Pre‑load leg drive by gently pushing back toward your head until you feel quad tension and your upper back locks in.\\n4) Unrack without losing that pressure. Keep steady leg drive through every rep.\\n\\nHeels down vs. toes tucked\\n- Heels down: Most stable for most lifters and required in some federations.\\n- Toes tucked (heels up slightly): Can increase your arch, but only if your butt stays down and feet don’t dance. If your butt pops, bring feet forward a bit, widen stance, or go heels down.\\n\\nCommon fixes\\n- Butt lifting: Move feet a touch forward, widen 1–2 inches, or reduce toe tuck. Keep drive back, not up.\\n- Dancing feet/heels lifting: Go heels down, toes out a bit more, and think “spread the floor.”\\n- Can’t reach floor/bench too high: Place plates or mats under your feet.\\n- Long legs: Wider stance with more toe‑out; heels may sit near the bench edge—still keep tripod contact.\\n- Short legs: Elevate feet on plates to keep shins near vertical and heels down.\\n\\nQuick self-check on your next set\\n- Are your feet motionless and fully planted?\\n- Do your shins look vertical/slightly back at the chest touch?\\n- Does your upper back feel more locked in as you push with the legs?\\n- Does the bar path stay smooth without your butt lifting?\\n\\nIf you send a side video (feet-to-bar) of 3–5 reps at working weight, I’ll pinpoint stance width, shin angle, and leg‑drive timing and give you exact tweaks.'"
