       "'Great question. A “good grip” on bench press keeps your wrists, elbows, and shoulders stacked so you can press safely and strongly.\\n\\nWhat to aim for\\n- Width: Choose a width that makes your forearms vertical when the bar touches mid-to-lower sternum.\\n  - Quick start: Place ring finger to index finger on the bar’s power rings (most people land between pinky-on-rings and index-on-rings). Adjust to get vertical forearms at the bottom.\\n- Wrist position: Bar sits low in the palm (near the wrist crease), not in the fingers. Knuckles to the ceiling. Wrist stacked directly over the elbow.\\n- Thumb: Use a full, closed grip (wrap the thumb) for safety and better force transfer.\\n- Elbows: Tuck about 30–45° from your torso as you lower; don’t flare straight out.\\n- Bar path: Down to mid/lower sternum, up over the shoulder joint.\\n\\nHow to find your exact width (2-minute setup)\\n1) Unrack an empty bar. Set your shoulder blades “down and back.”\\n2) Lower to mid/lower sternum and pause.\\n3) Look (or film from the front): are your forearms vertical? \\n   - If forearms “flare” outward at the bottom, you’re too wide. \\n   - If they angle inward, you’re too narrow.\\n4) Mark that hand placement on the knurling so you can repeat it every session.\\n\\nAdjust for goals and shoulder comfort\\n- General strength/hypertrophy: Moderate width (often pinky-to-ring finger on the rings). Elbows ~30–45°.\\n- Powerlifting/max strength: Slightly wider to reduce ROM (commonly ring finger to index on the rings), but keep forearms vertical and shoulders comfortable.\\n- Close grip (triceps/shoulder-friendly): Hands a bit inside shoulder width—narrow enough to emphasize triceps, but not so narrow that wrists collapse or elbows flare forward.\\n\\nCommon mistakes to avoid\\n- Thumbless/suicide grip (unsafe).\\n- Bar high in the fingers with bent wrists.\\n- Overly wide grip that strains shoulders.\\n- Inconsistent hand placement from set to set.\\n\\nIf you want, send a short front and side video of a few reps at working weight, and I’ll pinpoint your ideal width and any wrist/elbow stacking fixes.'"

Shins vertical to slightly angled back at the bottom. This lets you drive back toward your head without your butt popping up.\\n- Contact: Full “tripod” on each foot—big toe, little toe, and heel glued to the floor the entire set.\\n- Direction of force: Push the floor away/back toward your head to wedge your shoulders harder into the bench, not straight up.\\n\\nSimple setup (30 seconds)\\n1) Set your shoulder blades down and back.\\n2) Plant feet where you can keep full tripod contact; angle them slightly behind your knees.\\n3) Pre‑load leg drive by gently pushing back toward your head until you feel quad tension and your upper back locks in.\\n4) Unrack without losing that pressure. Keep steady leg drive through every rep.\\n\\nHeels down vs. toes tucked\\n- Heels down: Most stable for most lifters and required in some federations.\\n- Toes tucked (heels up slightly): Can increase your arch, but only if your butt stays down and feet don’t dance. If your butt pops, bring feet forward a bit, widen stance, or go heels down.\\n\\nCommon fixes\\n- Butt lifting: Move feet a touch forward, widen 1–2 inches, or reduce toe tuck. Keep drive back, not up.\\n- Dancing feet/heels lifting: Go heels down, toes out a bit more, and think “spread the floor.”\\n- Can’t reach floor/bench too high: Place plates or mats under your feet.\\n- Long legs: Wider stance with more toe‑out; heels may sit near the bench edge—still keep tripod contact.\\n- Short legs: Elevate feet on plates to keep shins near vertical and heels down.\\n\\nQuick self-check on your next set\\n- Are your feet motionless and fully planted?\\n- Do your shins look vertical/slightly back at the chest touch?\\n- Does your upper back feel more locked in as you push with the legs?\\n- Does the bar path stay smooth without your butt lifting?\\n\\nIf you send a side video (feet-to-bar) of 3–5 reps at working weight, I’ll pinpoint stance width, shin angle, and leg‑drive timing and give you exact tweaks.'"
