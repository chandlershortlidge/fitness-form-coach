      "shoulder strain if not executed with proper form.  2. **Thumb Position\n",

      "wrists straight and stacked directly over your forearms. Avoid letting\n",
      "them bend backward excessively to minimize strain and promote better\n",
      "bar control.  4. **Bar Location**:    - The bar should sit in the base\n",
      "of your palm, near the wrist, to allow for a more stable and powerful\n",
      "lift.  5. **Engagement**:    - Squeeze the bar tightly. A strong grip\n",
