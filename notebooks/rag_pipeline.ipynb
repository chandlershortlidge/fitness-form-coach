This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the overhead barbell press, or OHP, with perfect technique. With this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion, basically lifting your arm up overhead, which will be handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We'll also be performing elbow extension, which will hit all three heads of the triceps, and when viewed from the back, you can see that there will be scapular upward rotation occurring, handled by the upper traps. I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, although it usually does take longer to gain strength on than other exercises, so be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However,\")]\n"

However, if you're working inside a correctly set up power rack, a spotter is not absolutely necessary. Start with an empty bar. Lie down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this position, you should be far enough down from the bar—meaning toward the foot end of the bench—that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the downside of the bar. Your feet should be flat on the ground with your shins approximately vertical. Your upper back should be flat against the bench with your lower back in an anatomically normal arched position. Take an overhand grip on the bar; your grip should be somewhere between 22 and 24 inches measured between the index fingers. This grip width will result in a vertical forearm for most people when the bar is touching the chest at the bottom.

Muscle and strength are my pursuits. I'm the powerlifter, bodybuilder, scientist, and coach. I'm Layne Norton. I am a physique architect. The bench press is one of the most important upper body exercises. This makes it crucial for overall development and strength. A lot of people think about it as just a chest movement, but it incorporates the pectorals, the triceps, the shoulders, and even the back when done correctly. When it's done wrong, the results can be disastrous. Seven years ago, I tore my right pectoral bench pressing incorrectly. But over time, I learned to incorporate more muscle groups and focus on the movement itself. Not only did it become more safe, but my results were better. In this video, I'm going to teach you things I learned from top technique experts like Ben Escrow, Dr. Mike Zourdos, and Matt Gary to make my bench press more effective, safe, and fun.\")]\n"

      "- Elbows flare wide on the way down (closer to your shoulders than your torso).\n",
      "- You look at the bar during the rep. Your gaze changes as the bar moves.\n",
      "- Upper back doesn’t look fully “set,” and your feet don’t look firmly driving into the floor every rep.\n",
      "- Bar path looks mostly straight up/down. At lockout the bar isn’t clearly over the shoulder joint line before you descend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick fixes (use these cues next session)\n",
      "1) Grip/wrist and forearm stack\n",
      "   - Place the bar on the heel of your palm, directly over the forearm bones. Squeeze hard and “bend the bar/rip it in half.”\n",
      "   - Slightly pronate and internally rotate your arms so the forearm stays vertical when the bar touches your chest. Adjust grip width so your forearm is vertical at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Elbow angle on the descent\n",
      "   - Drop your elbows to roughly 45 degrees relative to your torso on the way down. This will line up the vertical forearm at the chest touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Upper back and setup tightness\n",
      "   - Pinch your shoulder blades together and plant your upper back into the bench as your platform.\n",
      "   - Establish four points of contact: head, upper back, glutes, and feet all firmly planted.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Eyes/bar path\n",
      "   - At unrack, move the bar to a position directly over your shoulder joints at lockout. Pick a spot on the ceiling there and stare at it the whole set—don’t watch the bar.\n",
      "   - Lower to your chest, touch without stopping, then drive the bar back toward that ceiling spot—think “throw it back” to create the slight upside‑down J path.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Brace and leg drive\n",
      "   - Big breath into your gut, chest up. As the bar touches, tighten your glutes and drive your feet into the floor to start the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unrack/rack\n",
