      "[Music] Welcome, everyone, to a new episode of Technique Tuesday. This week, we're going to look at how to perform the overhead barbell press, or OHP, with perfect technique. With this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion, basically lifting your arm up overhead. This is handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We'll also be performing elbow extension, engaging all three heads of the triceps. When viewed from the back, you can see scapular upward rotation, handled by the upper traps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, although it usually takes longer to gain strength on than other exercises. So be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However, there is one thing that I don't love about the overhead press: it is quite front deltoid dominant. A 2013 study comparing four shoulder press variations found that dumbbell presses were better than barbell presses for targeting the side delts. In both cases, doing presses standing rather than sitting was better for the side delts. So, if growing the side delt is the main goal, in addition to a lateral raise, you may want to include a dumbbell press. However, the range of motion may be cut shorter here, especially as you go heavier, as the bulky head of the dumbbell might start hitting your shoulders on the way down, ending the range of motion. In practice, it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises. While it isn't perfect on its own, I still like the overhead press as a core, bread-and-butter vertical pressing movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the OHP involves multiple joints and uses a large range of motion, it should generally be loaded with moderate to heavy weight, typically in the 5 to 10 rep zone. You want to set up the bar in a squat rack at the same height you would for a squat, somewhere around armpit height. Unrack the weight by gripping the bar with a slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip, so your hands are just outside your shoulders. Get your elbows underneath the bar, slightly bending the knees and hips, and stand up straight, lifting the bar off the rack. Take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with roughly a shoulder-width stance and a slight 15-degree foot flare. Point your elbows slightly outside your shoulders; this will be your starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I wouldn't normally recommend a thumbless, so-called suicide grip for anyone new to the movement, as you get more comfortable with it, the thumbless grip can be used here, as long as your wrists are stacked. This means from the side position, the bar should be resting above the wrist joint, not behind the wrist joint near the fingers. Externally rotate your shoulders, pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45-degree angle. You don't want them flared too much to the sides, as that can cause shoulder pain, and you don't want them straight in front of the shoulders, as that will limit your strength potential. With the bar resting on your upper chest or collarbone area, flex your glutes to ensure your spine is kept neutral and take a deep breath into your gut. Press the air out against your belt, if you have one, which will increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity as you press. While holding your breath, press the bar straight up—not up and forward or up and backward. When viewed from the side, the bar should be traveling up in a pretty much straight line. To keep the bar from hitting your chin, you'll have to slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press, then as you clear your face, push your head forward back to a neutral position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the concentric phase, keep your knees, hips, and shoulder blades motionless. A common error is shrugging your shoulders up to initiate the concentric off the chest. While this may make the movement easier in the short term, in the long term, it can weaken your bottom-end concentric pressing ability and limit your true max strength potential. Press the bar all the way up until your elbows lock out, with the bar overhead centered over the shoulder joint. At the end of the range of motion, there should be a straight line connecting the barbell, shoulders, hips, and the middle of the foot. This keeps everything balanced and prevents you from shifting your weight excessively forward onto your toes or backward onto your heels. Everything should be balanced directly over the middle of the foot. Start the eccentric by dropping your elbows down and to the side at a 45-degree angle—not straight down in front of your delts. Allow the bar to come to a full and complete stop here while you take in another full breath of air and begin another rep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, both the seated and standing dumbbell shoulder press make reasonable alternatives or additions here, since including isolateral movements can help prevent muscle imbalances and asymmetries. The seated variation will allow for the use of heavier loads, but the standing variation will increase stabilization demands, meaning more core and side delt activation. Unlike with the barbell press, with dumbbell variations, you can just press the dumbbells straight up, more out to the sides, since you don't need to worry about smashing your face on the way up. For the dumbbell variations, I prefer slightly higher reps, usually in the 8 to 15 rep zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common error I see is not using a full range of motion. Similar to the pull-up, many people cut the range of motion short at the top and the bottom—not going to full lockout and not touching the chest at the bottom. Keeping your range of motion consistent will ensure you're gaining strength through progressive overload, not progressive decreases in range of motion. Although not inherently problematic or injurious, I consider doing touch-and-go reps another error, as they create more inconsistent reps and often lead to bouncy reps with lots of momentum and reliance on the stretch reflex at the bottom. If any of this gets excessive, it can hinder your true brute pressing strength required to get the bar moving from a dead stop. A third error I see all the time is not flexing the glutes. The goal is to press the bar as vertically as comfortably possible, and keeping your glutes lax can result in the hips being back behind the bar, which reduces stability and often results in the bar being pressed forward rather than straight up. This is a bad habit and can strain your lower back, creating more inconsistency in both your bar path and form.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I have for the overhead press. Before you click out of this one, I have a quick rundown of what's planned for the next few Technique Tuesday episodes. You may have noticed I've been skipping leg day so far in the series. For the next three episodes, we'll cover three different lower body exercises, starting with the squat next week. I should note there is no real underlying method or meaning to the order in which I'm covering these exercises. I'm focusing on exercises smart to include in your program but spacing out the more time-consuming videos like the squat, bench press, and deadlift to avoid burning out on production too quickly. Those videos are all coming, and the whole series is mapped out until about mid-June.

      "Okay, welcome everyone to the first episode of Technique Tuesday, where every week we're going to take an in-depth look at the lost art and science of training technique. Just as a quick general outline, for the most part, we'll be breaking each exercise up into four sections: the muscles we're targeting, how to set up for the exercise, the execution of the movement, and common errors that I see many people make. Without further ado, let's jump right into it with the bench press exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The muscles we'll be targeting here, in order of involvement, are the pectoralis major (both the sternal - mid and lower - and clavicular, or upper heads), the triceps brachii, the anterior (or front) deltoid, and, to a lesser extent, the lats. The lats will actually only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, which is only at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, mainly carried out by the pecs and the anterior deltoids; some degree of shoulder flexion, carried out by the upper pecs and the front delt; and elbow extension, which will be mainly handled by the triceps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into the full setup, I think it's important to emphasize that you should only compare your bench strength to your starting place, not anyone else's bench strength. There are many extraneous factors that can contribute to performance on this lift, like your arm length, ribcage size, muscle origins and insertions, lumbar spine mobility, and the size and strength of your upper back for creating a stable base of support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup on the bench press is extremely important, so you may want to play this back a couple of times. What I'm going to go through first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons I've explained in other videos about maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I still think this style of bench press is a great mass builder for anyone with the primary goal of building size. I'll still throw in some tips that you can make if you purely have bodybuilding interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we go: first, you want to double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the middle of the rack, and that you have a spotter handy if you're training at high efforts. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar, your feet up on the bench, and squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the whole setup and execution of the lift. Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the uprights of the bench. Personally, I just prefer to grab the bar. Lift your hips up high while thinking about pulling your shoulder blades to your butt, which will help force you into scapular depression and push your upper body forward. Keep your feet in place; you can go up onto your toes if you find you can get more arch that way. At this point, your back should be planted on the bench, and your eyes should be directly under the barbell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs in close to the bench when viewed from the front. If a regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may have to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out to get your heels down. Also, make sure you've dropped your hips down so that your butt is touching the bench. Now you want to take your grip. At this point, I widen my grip, which is definitely on the wider side since I'm simply stronger with a wider grip.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that research has found that wider grips will target the sternal head of the pecs and the anterior delts more, while a closer grip will target the triceps and the clavicular or upper chest more. Using a variety of grip widths in training or experimenting and finding what works best for you makes sense. However, an important factor in determining grip width should be whether or not your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. Some advanced powerlifters won't always keep the joints perfectly stacked so they can get out wider. One 2007 study suggests that a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (so roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) is for reducing injury without seriously compromising maximal strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important point when it comes to grip: you want to make sure you have your wrist joints stacked, meaning from the side view, your wrist should be directly below your knuckles. Avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and you can correct this by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue. Right before the lift-off, I'll do one last check to make sure my shoulder blades are retracted and depressed by cranking my elbows forward, which I think of as me sort of screwing my back into position.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those strictly interested in bodybuilding, the same general setup can still apply; however, you won't need as extreme of an arch. You may want to take a slightly narrower grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a little further forward. But still, for the sake of shoulder health and stability, you'll want to keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, I think people tend to exaggerate the difference in range of motion between the big arch and a small arch. The distance traveled by the bar isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles: the position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is actually very similar despite the fact that the bar will have traveled further in the flat back press. You should get to work on building your arch and just not worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've got the bench press setup, it's time to actually execute the set, and we're going to break down the execution into four distinct phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unrack the bar by having your spotter help you lift out, not up, or if you're unracking by yourself, you may want to keep your butt elevated for the lift-off component and then drop your hips down once you've unracked. However, I prefer to just have a spotter handy whenever going near maximal effort to help with the lift-off. At this point, ensure you have four main points of contact: your head, upper back, glutes, and feet should all be planted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Now that you're in position, take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one. You can also cue yourself to puff your chest out at this point to expand your ribcage as much as possible. Grip the bar as hard as you can, and you can optionally use the cue to bend the bar or rip the bar in half, which will activate your upper back muscles to help maintain tightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. During the descent, drop your elbows down at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso when viewed from the top. There is unanimous agreement on this from the best powerlifting coaches. But when viewed from the side, the elbows shouldn't be too far out in front of the bar, and your goal should be to keep the elbows stacked under the bar. When viewed from the side, the descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. At the same time, you want to touch your chest just below nipple level toward the bottom of your sternum, which should be the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, which is required for competitive powerlifting. But if you're purely bodybuilding, you can simply tap your chest without a pause. Just ensure that the touch is controlled and you're not bouncing the weight off your chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. After your optional pause, explode the bar off your chest, driving your heels into the floor. Think about pressing the bar back toward your face and off your chest rather than just driving the bar straight up. You can also think about pushing the floor away from you with your feet to help initiate that leg drive and enforce this back-and-up bar path. Of course, you don't want to press the bar too far back, so it hits the rack, or you lose control. Bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring that starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way up, you're likely to encounter a sticking point if training at high efforts, where the lift will feel most difficult and is likely where you'll fail the lift if going for a max-effort set. Research shows that it tends to be in the first 20 to 40% of the movement, so about 3 to 4 inches off the chest, but that will be individual. Typically, the more advanced you are, the lower the sticking point will be; the newer you are, the more it'll be in the mid-range.\n",
      "\n",
      "To break through the sticking point, make sure you're pressing the bar up and back, not just straight up. You can also try flaring the elbows out a bit more, as this will get your pecs more involved to help the triceps. Think about lifting the bar off your chest with max speed, and that'll likely help you blast through that point where deceleration would normally happen. Personally, I think the simplest solution is that you probably just need stronger pecs and triceps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're accelerating past the sticking point, you now have the option to exhale, but you can hold your breath until you completely lock the lift out. As you near the end range of motion, the bar should complete that arc back toward the starting position, with the bar back over the nipples. At this point, you would just repeat the process starting with bracing, descending, and pressing again for however many reps your program calls for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three common errors that I see all the time with the bench press are:\n",
      "1. Over-tucking or under-tucking the elbows. The cue to tuck your elbows originated in equipped powerlifting, but without a bench shirt, this cue probably won't be as helpful. It's just as common to see people not tucking enough, flaring their elbows out completely parallel with the bar. This is also not ideal since it puts your shoulder at an increased risk of injury and makes the bar path much less efficient, as the bar is forced to go straight up and down. Most people simply won't be as strong benching with completely flared elbows. A slight tuck is good; however, as you get to the sticking point, more of a flare might help you get the elbows more stacked under the bar and allow you to finish the lift. If you have difficulty figuring out how you're using your elbows, I'd recommend doing slow eccentric presses with lighter weights while being mindful of where your elbows are and where they're going.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Benching with a completely flat back. You may not need quite as extreme of an arch as a competitive powerlifter, but maintaining some arch in your spine confers at least three major benefits. First, the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs are actually safer in the lordotic or arched position. The more decline pushing angle is safer for the shoulder joint, and you'll most likely be stronger in this position, meaning more total load will be placed on the active muscle groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lack of leg drive. If your feet are just positioned wherever or just out in front of you on the bench rather than tucked in behind you, you're not maximizing your strength potential on the bench press. Figuring out how to use your legs in the bench press may take time, but it's important to master. I've linked a few good articles down in the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside this video, I'm releasing my bench press specialization program. Like most of my programs, this is more of a bench press training manual, and it covers more detail than I had time to touch on in this video. It comes with an eight-week training program designed for intermediate to advanced-level lifters who have the goal of increasing strength on their bench press. It's more than just a bench program; it's an upper-lower training split that will have you in the gym five days per week, with a specific focus on developing bench strength as the exercise is hit three times per week using daily undulating periodization. The program is $29.99, but if you use the discount code TECHNIQUETUESDAY, you'll be able to save 10 bucks off, knocking it down to $19.99 for the first week of launch. You can learn more about that on my website at jeffnippard.com or by clicking the first link in the description.\n",

Just as a quick general outline, for the most part, we'll be breaking each exercise up into four sections: the muscles we're targeting, how to set up for the exercise, the execution of the movement, and common errors that I see many people make. Without further ado, let's jump right into it with the bench press exercise.\"),\n",

The lats will actually only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, which is only at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, mainly carried out by the pecs and the anterior deltoids; some degree of shoulder flexion, carried out by the upper pecs and the front delt; and elbow extension, which will be mainly handled by the triceps.\"),\n",

There are many extraneous factors that can contribute to performance on this lift, like your arm length, ribcage size, muscle origins and insertions, lumbar spine mobility, and the size and strength of your upper back for creating a stable base of support.\\n\\nThe setup on the bench press is extremely important, so you may want to play this back a couple of times. What I'm going to go through first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons I've explained in other videos about maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I still think this style of bench press is a great mass builder for anyone with the primary goal of building size.

Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar, your feet up on the bench, and squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the whole setup and execution of the lift. Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the uprights of the bench. Personally, I just prefer to grab the bar. Lift your hips up high while thinking about pulling your shoulder blades to your butt, which will help force you into scapular depression and push your upper body forward. Keep your feet in place; you can go up onto your toes if you find you can get more arch that way.

Also, make sure you've dropped your hips down so that your butt is touching the bench. Now you want to take your grip. At this point, I widen my grip, which is definitely on the wider side since I'm simply stronger with a wider grip.\"),\n",

Using a variety of grip widths in training or experimenting and finding what works best for you makes sense. However, an important factor in determining grip width should be whether or not your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. Some advanced powerlifters won't always keep the joints perfectly stacked so they can get out wider. One 2007 study suggests that a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (so roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) is for reducing injury without seriously compromising maximal strength.\"),\n",

Avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and you can correct this by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue. Right before the lift-off, I'll do one last check to make sure my shoulder blades are retracted and depressed by cranking my elbows forward, which I think of as me sort of screwing my back into position.\\n\\nFor those strictly interested in bodybuilding, the same general setup can still apply; however, you won't need as extreme of an arch. You may want to take a slightly narrower grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a little further forward. But still, for the sake of shoulder health and stability, you'll want to keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine.\"),\n",

The distance traveled by the bar isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles: the position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is actually very similar despite the fact that the bar will have traveled further in the flat back press. You should get to work on building your arch and just not worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\\n\\nNow that we've got the bench press setup, it's time to actually execute the set, and we're going to break down the execution into four distinct phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press.\"),\n",

You can also cue yourself to puff your chest out at this point to expand your ribcage as much as possible.

During the descent, drop your elbows down at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso when viewed from the top. There is unanimous agreement on this from the best powerlifting coaches. But when viewed from the side, the elbows shouldn't be too far out in front of the bar, and your goal should be to keep the elbows stacked under the bar. When viewed from the side, the descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. At the same time, you want to touch your chest just below nipple level toward the bottom of your sternum, which should be the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, which is required for competitive powerlifting.

      "Okay, welcome, everyone, to a new episode of Technique Tuesday. This week, we're going to look at how to perform the squat with perfect technique. The back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises, and even the king of all exercises, a title I believe it deserves. Before we jump into the technique, let's examine which muscles the squat targets. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the squat, we're training simultaneous hip extension, where the hips straighten out on the way up, and knee extension, where the knees straighten out. The hip extension is primarily handled by the glutes, with assistance from the adductor magnus. Although the hamstrings can perform hip extension, they don't contribute much to the squat due to the bent knee, meaning their muscle length doesn't change much during the range of motion. The knee extension component is handled by the quadriceps, and we perform an isometric lumbar extension contraction handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back. \n",
      "\n",
      "A common misconception is that the abs are highly active in the squat, but EMG data shows low abdominal activity. This makes sense given that their function—spinal flexion and anti-extension—doesn't occur in the squat. We're mainly targeting the glutes, quads, and spinal erectors. Because the squat involves multiple joints and large muscle masses, it is conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep zone. While there are exceptions, doing squats for more than 10 reps will usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature, leading to sloppy form, decreased strength gains, and lower muscle activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, I recommend loading the squat with at least 70% of your one-rep max, or in the five to ten rep range if your goal is primarily hypertrophy, and the three to six rep range if your goal is primarily strength. However, there will be exceptions to this. It is important to be very objective about your form. Consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique, then build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible is better than taking time off due to injury from lifting beyond your capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before approaching the bar, check to make sure you have the right weight on both sides and that the bar is centered in the rack. Position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar, you aren't hitting the J-hooks during the walkout. For most people, armpit height is a good height. People often exaggerate the difference between a high bar squat, with the bar resting on your traps, and a low bar squat, with it resting on your rear delts. Research shows the high bar squat may be more quad-dominant, and the low bar squat more hip-dominant. In my experience, the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and feels more comfortable for many people, so we'll be using that position here. The bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward, and too low if it feels like it’s going to slide down your back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your hands should be as close to your shoulders as possible, activating the upper back muscles better, leading to a more stable base for the bar. Your hands should stabilize the bar, keeping it between your palms and upper back; you shouldn’t be actively gripping it like in a bench press. Let it settle on your upper back. With both feet underneath the bar, push your hips forward to unrack it. Don’t squat the bar up with your knees, which causes unnecessary quad fatigue and can contribute to knee pain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take three steps backward: one small step with your non-dominant leg, one medium step with the other, and then a mini step to even your feet. Your feet should have 15 to 30 degrees of foot flare, wider than shoulder-width. Now you’re set up; it’s time to execute the lift—split into three phases: brace, descend, and lift. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the bracing phase, your heel and big toe should make even pressure on the ground, with weight centered in the middle of your foot. The cue to keep weight on your heels can throw off balance and result in hips shooting up early. Your head should be slightly extended, eyes gazing straight ahead, and elbows pointing slightly back. Pull a breath of air deep into your diaphragm, pushing your gut against your belt to create a rigid column down your spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the high bar position, break at the hips and knees simultaneously. Push your knees forward and slightly out to track the toes, while sitting hips straight down. Push through your heel, big toe, and pinky toe, maintaining weight distribution through your feet. Viewed from the side, the bar path should be a straight line over the middle of your foot. Lower under control, driving your upper back into the bar and preventing your chest from falling forward. You don’t want to descend excessively slowly, just a one-second negative is fine on the squat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Squat to at least parallel to the ground for hypertrophy and general strength. For regulation technique, get the hip crease below the knee joint, meaning below parallel. Most should achieve this with a high bar position and appropriate stance width. Unless doing paused squats specifically, don’t pause in the hole; immediately reverse, taking advantage of the stretch reflex at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintain an upright posture in the positive. Avoid the chest-up cue, as it can cause leaning backward. Think about driving your back up into the bar while keeping your head slightly up. Don’t focus on squeezing muscles or feeling the burn—focus on exploding out of the hole. I hold my breath until two-thirds up, then exhale. Once back up, begin bracing, take another deep breath, and repeat for the required reps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common errors: knee valgus (knees caving in), usually from a lack of hip external rotation. Ensure feet are adequately flared. Drive knees out in the direction of your toes, but not excessively. A mini band or hip circle around the knees can cue this and strengthen the hip abductors. Heeled squat shoes can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid going too heavy and not going deep enough. Since the squat starts with the eccentric phase, it’s easier to cheat with more weight than you can handle. Be wary of butt wink, or lower back rounding. If excessive, consider cutting depth shorter or modifying stance width. Some degree of butt wink is inevitable for many and not a big concern if mild.

This week, we're going to look at how to perform the squat with perfect technique. The back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises, and even the king of all exercises, a title I believe it deserves. Before we jump into the technique, let's examine which muscles the squat targets. \\n\\nWith the squat, we're training simultaneous hip extension, where the hips straighten out on the way up, and knee extension, where the knees straighten out. The hip extension is primarily handled by the glutes, with assistance from the adductor magnus. Although the hamstrings can perform hip extension, they don't contribute much to the squat due to the bent knee, meaning their muscle length doesn't change much during the range of motion. The knee extension component is handled by the quadriceps, and we perform an isometric lumbar extension contraction handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back.\"),\n",

This makes sense given that their function—spinal flexion and anti-extension—doesn't occur in the squat. We're mainly targeting the glutes, quads, and spinal erectors. Because the squat involves multiple joints and large muscle masses, it is conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep zone. While there are exceptions, doing squats for more than 10 reps will usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature, leading to sloppy form, decreased strength gains, and lower muscle activation.\"),\n",

However, there will be exceptions to this. It is important to be very objective about your form. Consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique, then build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible is better than taking time off due to injury from lifting beyond your capability.'),\n",

Position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar, you aren't hitting the J-hooks during the walkout. For most people, armpit height is a good height. People often exaggerate the difference between a high bar squat, with the bar resting on your traps, and a low bar squat, with it resting on your rear delts. Research shows the high bar squat may be more quad-dominant, and the low bar squat more hip-dominant. In my experience, the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and feels more comfortable for many people, so we'll be using that position here. The bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward, and too low if it feels like it’s going to slide down your back.\"),\n",

Your hands should stabilize the bar, keeping it between your palms and upper back; you shouldn’t be actively gripping it like in a bench press. Let it settle on your upper back. With both feet underneath the bar, push your hips forward to unrack it. Don’t squat the bar up with your knees, which causes unnecessary quad fatigue and can contribute to knee pain. \\n\\nTake three steps backward: one small step with your non-dominant leg, one medium step with the other, and then a mini step to even your feet. Your feet should have 15 to 30 degrees of foot flare, wider than shoulder-width. Now you’re set up; it’s time to execute the lift—split into three phases: brace, descend, and lift.'),\n",

The cue to keep weight on your heels can throw off balance and result in hips shooting up early. Your head should be slightly extended, eyes gazing straight ahead, and elbows pointing slightly back. Pull a breath of air deep into your diaphragm, pushing your gut against your belt to create a rigid column down your spine.'),\n",

Push your knees forward and slightly out to track the toes, while sitting hips straight down. Push through your heel, big toe, and pinky toe, maintaining weight distribution through your feet. Viewed from the side, the bar path should be a straight line over the middle of your foot. Lower under control, driving your upper back into the bar and preventing your chest from falling forward. You don’t want to descend excessively slowly, just a one-second negative is fine on the squat.\\n\\nSquat to at least parallel to the ground for hypertrophy and general strength. For regulation technique, get the hip crease below the knee joint, meaning below parallel. Most should achieve this with a high bar position and appropriate stance width.

Avoid the chest-up cue, as it can cause leaning backward. Think about driving your back up into the bar while keeping your head slightly up. Don’t focus on squeezing muscles or feeling the burn—focus on exploding out of the hole. I hold my breath until two-thirds up, then exhale. Once back up, begin bracing, take another deep breath, and repeat for the required reps.\\n\\nCommon errors: knee valgus (knees caving in), usually from a lack of hip external rotation. Ensure feet are adequately flared. Drive knees out in the direction of your toes, but not excessively. A mini band or hip circle around the knees can cue this and strengthen the hip abductors. Heeled squat shoes can help.'),\n",
