This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the overhead barbell press, or OHP, with perfect technique. With this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion, basically lifting your arm up overhead, which will be handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We'll also be performing elbow extension, which will hit all three heads of the triceps, and when viewed from the back, you can see that there will be scapular upward rotation occurring, handled by the upper traps. I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, although it usually does take longer to gain strength on than other exercises, so be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However,\"),\n",

Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However, there is one thing that I don't love about the overhead press, and that is that it is quite front deltoid dominant. One 2013 study comparing four shoulder press variations found that dumbbell presses were better than barbell presses for targeting the side delts, and in both cases, doing your presses standing rather than sitting was better for the side delts. So, if growing the side delt is the main goal, in addition to a lateral raise, you may want to include a dumbbell press. However, the range of motion may be cut shorter here, especially as you go heavier, as the bulky head of the dumbbell might start hitting your shoulders on the way down, ending the range of motion. In practice, I think it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises, and while it isn't perfect on its own, I do\"),\n",

In practice, I think it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises, and while it isn't perfect on its own, I do still like the overhead press as a core, sort of bread-and-butter, vertical pressing movement. Because the OHP involves multiple joints and uses a large range of motion, generally speaking, it should be loaded with moderate to heavy weight, somewhere in the 5 to 10 rep zone. You want to set up the bar in a squat rack at the same height you would for a squat, somewhere around armpit height. You want to unrack the weight by gripping the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip, so your hands are just outside your shoulders. Get your elbows underneath the bar while slightly bending the knees and hips and stand up straight, lifting the bar up off the rack. Take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with a roughly shoulder-width stance and a slight 15-degree foot flare.\"),\n",

Take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with a roughly shoulder-width stance and a slight 15-degree foot flare. You want to point your elbows slightly outside your shoulders, and this will be your starting position. Although I wouldn't normally recommend a thumbless, so-called suicide grip for anyone new to the movement, as you get more comfortable with it, I think the thumbless grip can be used here as long as your wrists are stacked, meaning from the side position the bar should be resting above the wrist joint, not behind the wrist joint near the fingers. You want to externally rotate your shoulders, pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45-degree angle. You don't want them flared too much out to the sides, which can cause shoulder pain, and you don't want them straight in front of the shoulders, which will limit your strength potential.

With the bar resting on your upper chest or collarbone area, you want to flex your glutes to ensure that your spine is kept neutral and take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one, which is going to increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity. As you press, while holding your breath, press the bar straight up, not up and forward or up and backward. When viewed from the side, the bar should be traveling up in a pretty much straight line. In order to keep the bar from hitting your chin, you'll have to slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press, then as you clear your face, push your head forward back to a neutral position.

Press the bar all the way up until your elbows lock out with the bar overhead centered over the shoulder joint. At the end of the range of motion, there should be a pretty much straight line connecting the barbell, the shoulders, the hips, and the middle of the foot. This will keep everything in balance and prevent you from shifting your weight excessively forward onto your toes or backward onto your heels.

Allow the bar to come to a full and complete stop here while you take in another full breath of air and begin another rep. Of course, I think both the seated and the standing dumbbell shoulder press make for reasonable alternatives or additions here, since including isolateral movements can help prevent muscle imbalances and asymmetries. The seated variation will allow for the use of heavier loads; however, the standing variation will increase stabilization demands, meaning more core and side delt activation.

Similar to the pull-up, many people will cut the range of motion short at the top and the bottom, not going to full lockout and also not touching the chest at the bottom. Keeping your range of motion consistent will ensure you're actually gaining strength through progressive overload, not progressive decreases in range of motion. Although not inherently problematic or injurious, I am going to consider doing touch-and-go reps as another error here, since they're going to create more inconsistent reps and often lead to bouncy reps with lots of momentum and reliance on that stretch reflex at the bottom.

A third error that I see here all the time is not flexing the glutes. The goal of this exercise is to press the bar as vertically as you comfortably can, and keeping your glutes relaxed will usually result in the hips being back behind the bar, which reduces stability and more often than not results in the bar being pressed forward rather than straight up. This is a bad habit and can put a lot of strain on your lower back and create more inconsistency in both your bar path and form in general.

They'll only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, carried out mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids, some degree of shoulder flexion by the upper pecs and front delt, and elbow extension, primarily handled by the triceps.\\n\\nBefore we get into the full setup, it's important to emphasize that you should only compare your bench strength to your starting place and not to anyone else's. Many extraneous factors can contribute to performance on this lift, like arm length, rib cage size, muscle origins and insertions, lumbar spine mobility, and the size and strength of your upper back for creating a stable base of support.\"),\n",

First, double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the rack, and that you have a spotter handy if you're training at high efforts. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar. With your feet up on the bench, squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the setup and execution of the lift. Setup your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the bench's uprights. I prefer just grabbing the bar. Lift your hips high, pulling your shoulder blades to your butt. This helps force you into scapular depression and pushes your upper body forward, keeping your feet in place.

Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench when viewed from the front. If using regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may need to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out. Make sure your hips are down so your butt touches the bench. Take your grip at this point. I widen my grip, which is on the wider side, as I'm stronger with a wider grip.\"),\n",

Using a variety of grip widths and experimenting to find what works best for you makes sense. However, an important factor in determining grip width is whether your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's worth noting advanced powerlifters may not always keep the joints perfectly stacked. A 2007 study suggests a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) can reduce injury risk without seriously compromising maximal strength.\"),\n",

You won't need as extreme of an arch, and may want to take a slightly more narrow grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a bit further forward, but still, for shoulder health and stability, keep your shoulder blades retracted and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine. People tend to exaggerate the difference in range of motion between a big arch and a small arch. It's worth noting that the distance traveled by the bar isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles. The position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is similar despite the bar traveling further in the flat back press. You should work on building your arch and not worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\"),\n",

I prefer having a spotter near a maximal effort to help with the liftoff. Ensure you have four main points of contact: your head, upper back, glutes, and feet should all be planted. In position, take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one. You can cue yourself to puff your chest out to expand the rib cage as much as possible. Grip the bar as hard as you can. You can optionally use the cue to bend the bar or rip it in half, activating your upper back muscles to maintain tightness.

Touch your chest just below nipple level, toward the bottom of your sternum, which should be the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, which is required for competitive powerlifting. For bodybuilding, simply tap your chest without a pause.

Don't press the bar too far back; it shouldn't hit the rack or cause you to lose control. Bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring the starting position. On the way up, you might encounter a sticking point if training at high efforts where the lift feels most difficult. It's likely where you'll fail the lift if going for a max effort set.

The cue to tuck your elbows originated in equipped powerlifting, but without a bench shirt, it may not be helpful for you. It's just as common to see people not tucking enough, flaring their elbows out parallel with the bar. This is also not ideal; it puts your shoulder at an increased risk of injury and makes the bar path less efficient since it's forced to go straight up and down. Most won't be as strong benching with flared elbows. A slight tuck is good. As you get to the sticking point, more of a flair might help you finish the lift. If you have difficulty figuring out how you're using your elbows, I'd recommend slow eccentric presses with lighter weights to be mindful of where your elbows are and where they're going.\"),\n",

You may not need as extreme of an arch as a competitive powerlifter, but maintaining some arch confers at least three major benefits: first, the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs are safer in the lordotic or arched position; the more decline pushing angle is safer for the shoulder joint; and you'll likely be stronger in this position, meaning more total load on the active muscle groups.\\n\\nThe third error is a lack of leg drive. If your feet are positioned wherever, just out in front of you on the bench rather than tucked behind you, you're not maximizing your strength potential.

Just as a quick general outline, for the most part, we will break each exercise into four sections. We will look at the muscles we'll be targeting, how to set up for the exercise, the execution of the movement, and common errors that I see many people make. So without further ado, let's jump right into it with the bench press exercise.\"),\n",

They'll only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, carried out mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids, some degree of shoulder flexion by the upper pecs and front delt, and elbow extension, primarily handled by the triceps.\\n\\nBefore we get into the full setup, it's important to emphasize that you should only compare your bench strength to your starting place and not to anyone else's. Many extraneous factors can contribute to performance on this lift, like arm length, rib cage size, muscle origins and insertions, lumbar spine mobility, and the size and strength of your upper back for creating a stable base of support.\"),\n",

First, double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the rack, and that you have a spotter handy if you're training at high efforts. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar. With your feet up on the bench, squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the setup and execution of the lift. Setup your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the bench's uprights. I prefer just grabbing the bar. Lift your hips high, pulling your shoulder blades to your butt. This helps force you into scapular depression and pushes your upper body forward, keeping your feet in place. You can go up onto your toes if you find you can get more arch that way.\"),\n",

Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench when viewed from the front. If using regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may need to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out. Make sure your hips are down so your butt touches the bench. Take your grip at this point. I widen my grip, which is on the wider side, as I'm stronger with a wider grip.\"),\n",

Using a variety of grip widths and experimenting to find what works best for you makes sense. However, an important factor in determining grip width is whether your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's worth noting advanced powerlifters may not always keep the joints perfectly stacked. A 2007 study suggests a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) can reduce injury risk without seriously compromising maximal strength.\"),\n",

From the side view, your wrist should be directly below your knuckles, avoiding excessive hyperextension. You can correct this by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue. Before the lift-off, do one last check to make sure your shoulder blades are retracted and depressed by cranking your elbows forward, which I think of as screwing my back into position.'),\n",

You won't need as extreme of an arch, and may want to take a slightly more narrow grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a bit further forward, but still, for shoulder health and stability, keep your shoulder blades retracted and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine. People tend to exaggerate the difference in range of motion between a big arch and a small arch. It's worth noting that the distance traveled by the bar isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles. The position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is similar despite the bar traveling further in the flat back press. You should work on building your arch and not worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\"),\n",

We'll break the execution into four phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press. First, unrack the bar with your spotter's help, lifting out, not up, or, if unracking by yourself, keep your butt elevated for the liftoff component, then drop your hips once you've unracked. I prefer having a spotter near a maximal effort to help with the liftoff. Ensure you have four main points of contact: your head, upper back, glutes, and feet should all be planted. In position, take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one. You can cue yourself to puff your chest out to expand the rib cage as much as possible. Grip the bar as hard as you can. You can optionally use the cue to bend the bar or rip it in half, activating your upper back muscles to maintain tightness.

During the descent, drop your elbows at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso when viewed from the top. There's unanimous agreement on this from the best powerlifting coaches. When viewed from the side, the elbows shouldn't be too far in front of the bar. Aim to keep the elbow stacked under the bar. The descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. Touch your chest just below nipple level, toward the bottom of your sternum, which should be the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, which is required for competitive powerlifting. For bodybuilding, simply tap your chest without a pause. Ensure the touch is well controlled and not bouncing the weight off your chest.\"),\n",

Think about pressing the bar back toward your face and off your chest, rather than just driving the bar straight up. Think about pushing the floor away from you with your feet to help initiate leg drive and enforce this back-and-up bar path. Don't press the bar too far back; it shouldn't hit the rack or cause you to lose control. Bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring the starting position. On the way up, you might encounter a sticking point if training at high efforts where the lift feels most difficult. It's likely where you'll fail the lift if going for a max effort set. Research shows it tends to be in the first 20 to 40% of the movement, about 3 to 4 inches off the chest.

The cue to tuck your elbows originated in equipped powerlifting, but without a bench shirt, it may not be helpful for you. It's just as common to see people not tucking enough, flaring their elbows out parallel with the bar. This is also not ideal; it puts your shoulder at an increased risk of injury and makes the bar path less efficient since it's forced to go straight up and down. Most won't be as strong benching with flared elbows. A slight tuck is good. As you get to the sticking point, more of a flair might help you finish the lift. If you have difficulty figuring out how you're using your elbows, I'd recommend slow eccentric presses with lighter weights to be mindful of where your elbows are and where they're going.\"),\n",

You may not need as extreme of an arch as a competitive powerlifter, but maintaining some arch confers at least three major benefits: first, the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs are safer in the lordotic or arched position; the more decline pushing angle is safer for the shoulder joint; and you'll likely be stronger in this position, meaning more total load on the active muscle groups.\\n\\nThe third error is a lack of leg drive. If your feet are positioned wherever, just out in front of you on the bench rather than tucked behind you, you're not maximizing your strength potential. Figuring out how to use your legs in the bench press may take time, but mastering it is important. I've linked a few good articles in the description.\"),\n",

However, if you're working inside a correctly set up power rack, a spotter is not absolutely necessary. Start with an empty bar. Lie down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this position, you should be far enough down from the bar—meaning toward the foot end of the bench—that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the downside of the bar. Your feet should be flat on the ground with your shins approximately vertical. Your upper back should be flat against the bench with your lower back in an anatomically normal arched position. Take an overhand grip on the bar; your grip should be somewhere between 22 and 24 inches measured between the index fingers.

Look directly up at the ceiling and push up on the bar, locking out your elbows. Move the bar out to a position directly over the line of your shoulder joints. This is the place where the bar is in balance at lockout.

This tactile cue will quite effectively identify the point on your chest to touch the bar. If there is no spotter and you're benching alone inside a rack, unlock your elbows and then allow them to drop towards your feet a little on the way down. If you do this correctly, the net effect will be the same as the spotter's touch. The bar will contact your sternum a few inches below your clavicles and therefore below your shoulder joints.

Do another set of five with the bar, reinforcing your eye position, and then rack the bar. This is done with locked elbows after the last rep is finished. Should you have a spotter, this movement back to the rack should be covered. Now that we've covered the basic movement pattern for the bench press, we can maximize the efficiency of the lift by improving the position of the upper back, legs, and feet.

This pinching will also cause you to raise your chest, further contributing to a good position. Now lie down, take the bar out, and assume this same position, making sure your shoulder blades are pinched together and your chest is up high. Your goal is to be able to do all your reps without losing this set position against the bench.

Muscle and strength are my pursuits. I'm the powerlifter, bodybuilder, scientist, and coach. I'm Layne Norton. I am a physique architect. The bench press is one of the most important upper body exercises. This makes it crucial for overall development and strength. A lot of people think about it as just a chest movement, but it incorporates the pectorals, the triceps, the shoulders, and even the back when done correctly. When it's done wrong, the results can be disastrous. Seven years ago, I tore my right pectoral bench pressing incorrectly. But over time, I learned to incorporate more muscle groups and focus on the movement itself. Not only did it become more safe, but my results were better.

Now, you don't need any equipment other than yourself to bench press, but there are certain things that can make your bench press more effective and safe. Not many people give much thought to footwear on a bench press, but your feet are what connect you to the ground and form your base. Now, footwear is a little bit of personal preference, but you want something with a lot of grip. Personally, I like to use squat shoes. They have an elevated heel, which helps me get my foot flat on the floor and connect with it better. They also have really good grip on the bottom, and that helps keep my feet from sliding.

If you're going to create the maximum amount of force, you want to be able to keep your wrist in a straight line. Wrist straps give joint support, helping you keep your wrist in a straight line. I recommend a good pair of powerlifting wrist straps anywhere from 12 to 36 inches, depending on what you prefer. Many people make the mistake of wrapping their wrists too low.

Now, this tends to be a little bit of a controversial topic, especially amongst bodybuilders. Many bodybuilders don't think they should arch; they think that an arch is just a powerlifting move. But arching your lower back will help keep your spine neutral and protect it while you're pressing. It'll also ensure your overall back stays tighter. Now, if you're not concerned about powerlifting, maybe you don't need to arch as much as powerlifters, but you should still keep a slight arch in your lower back. If you're a powerlifter, then you want to arch as much as you possibly can to minimize the distance the bar has to travel.\"),\n",

Squeezing your shoulder blades together will allow you to stay tighter. It also protects the shoulders. What I mean by squeezing shoulder blades together is to think about if you had a grape between your shoulder blades—you want to squeeze so tight that you crush that grape. Just like on squat, we want to breathe to create the maximum amount of intra-abdominal pressure so we can brace more effectively and move more weight. Before you begin the movement, you want to take in a deep breath, unrack the bar, blow that breath out, and take in another new deep breath before you start your first rep. Then you want to hold it and blow out forcefully as you lock out the weight. This will enable you to use more weight more effectively.'),\n",

Let's talk execution. After you've unracked the bar and you're ready to start your first rep, you want to take in a big breath and brace your abdominal wall, just like you would on squat or deadlift. Once you're braced, to initiate lowering the bar, think about trying to bend the bar into a U. This will enable the bar to lower naturally in a good position with your elbows tucked. By thinking about bending the bar, you're going to naturally engage your lats and tuck your elbows. We don't want to flare our elbows excessively on the bench press. Tucking your elbows ensures that you'll engage your lats and press in a more safe and efficient manner. Another cue that may work is to protect your armpits.\"),\n",

One of the most important things for an efficient bench press is to keep your forearm at 90 degrees to the ground. If it moves in either direction, you're going to be losing energy transfer as you press up with the bar. Somebody who has long arms and grips narrow is going to have to touch very low on their body. If somebody has very short arms and grips very wide, they could touch very high and still keep the forearm at 90 degrees to the ground. But as we discussed, I don't recommend extreme grips in either direction. For most people, they're going to hit anywhere from their top ab to their nipple line.\"),\n",

This may seem like a strange cue, but just like on squat and deadlift, using leg drive is going to enable you to use more weight and stay tighter. Now, on the bench press, because our feet are not directly under the bar, it's not as important as it is on squats and deadlifts. But we're still trying to get every little bit of efficiency that we can out of our movement. As you start to press up, you want to think about throwing the bar back as you start the lockout process. Remember, we're pressing the bar in an upside-down J path. Ideally, we'd have a completely straight bar path, but with most people on the bench press, that's not going to be possible. If they do, the bar ends up too far away from you as you lock out and creates extra torque on your shoulders.\"),\n",

Not only is this dangerous because of the force you create on your sternum, but it's almost impossible to stay tight and controlled when you're bouncing the bar off your chest. And if you're bouncing it, are you really moving the weight? Another mistake is people don't breathe properly and brace properly. If you're not taking a big breath before you start and bracing your abdominal wall correctly, it's going to be less safe, and you're not going to be able to stay as tight and use as much weight.\"),\n",

This tends to go hand in hand with flaring elbows out too wide. Many people tend to roll their shoulders forward as they finish the movement, but this is going to make you stay less tight and has a greater chance of leading to some sort of shoulder injury over the course of your lifting career. Another mistake that coincides with flaring elbows and rolling shoulders is unlocking your shoulder blades. Many people will unlock their shoulder blades as they finish a bench press because they feel it will enable them to lock out more weight, but that's not the case. It will cause you to lose tightness and increase the possibility of injury.\"),\n",

Remember, lifting weights is a skill, just like any other sport, and the more times you do it, the better you will get at that skill.
