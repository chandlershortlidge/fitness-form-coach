      "[Music] \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, welcome everyone to a new episode of Technique Tuesday. This week we're going to be looking at how to perform the overhead barbell press, or OHP, with perfect technique. With this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion, basically lifting your arm up overhead, which will be handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We'll also be performing elbow extension, which will hit all three heads of the triceps. When viewed from the back, you can see that there will be scapular upward rotation occurring, handled by the upper traps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, although it usually takes longer to gain strength on than other exercises, so be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However, there is one thing that I don't love about the overhead press, and that is it is quite front deltoid dominant. \n",
      "\n",
      "One 2013 study comparing four shoulder press variations found that dumbbell presses were better than barbell presses for targeting the side delts, and in both cases, doing your presses standing rather than sitting was better for the side delts. So if growing the side delt is the main goal, in addition to a lateral raise, you may want to include a dumbbell press. However, the range of motion may be cut shorter here, especially as you go heavier, as the bulky head of the dumbbell might start hitting your shoulders on the way down, ending the range of motion. In practice, I think it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises. While it isn't perfect on its own, I do still like the overhead press as a core, sort of bread-and-butter, vertical pressing movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, because the OHP involves multiple joints and uses a large range of motion, generally speaking it should be loaded with moderate to heavy weight, somewhere in the 5 to 10 rep zone. You want to set up the bar in a squat rack at the same height you would for a squat, somewhere around armpit height. Unrack the weight by gripping the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip, so your hands are just outside your shoulders. Get your elbows underneath the bar while slightly bending the knees and hips, and stand up straight, lifting the bar up off the rack. Take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with a roughly shoulder-width stance and a slight 15-degree foot flare. Point your elbows slightly outside your shoulders, and this will be your starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I wouldn't normally recommend a thumbless, so-called suicide grip for anyone new to the movement, as you get more comfortable with it, I think the thumbless grip can be used here as long as your wrists are stacked. Meaning from the side position, the bar should be resting above the wrist joint, not behind the wrist joint near the fingers. You want to externally rotate your shoulders, pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45-degree angle. You don't want them flared too much out to the sides, which can cause shoulder pain, and you don't want them straight in front of the shoulders, which will limit your strength potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the bar resting on your upper chest or collarbone area, flex your glutes to ensure that your spine is kept neutral, and take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one. This is going to increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity as you press. While holding your breath, press the bar straight up—not up and forward or up and backward—so when viewed from the side, the bar should be traveling up in a pretty much straight line. To keep the bar from hitting your chin, you'll have to slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press, then as you clear your face, push your head forward back to a neutral position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the concentric, keep your knees, hips, and shoulder blades motionless. The common error here is to shrug your shoulders up to initiate the concentric off the chest. While this may make the movement easier in the short term, I think in the long term it really can weaken your bottom-end concentric pressing ability and end up limiting your true max strength potential. Press the bar all the way up until your elbows lock out, with the bar overhead centered over the shoulder joint. At the end of the range of motion, there should be a pretty much straight line connecting the barbell, the shoulders, the hips, and the middle of the foot. This will keep everything in balance and prevent you from shifting your weight excessively forward onto your toes or backward onto your heels. Everything should be balanced directly over the middle of the foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start the eccentric by dropping your elbows down and to the side at a 45-degree angle, so not straight down in front of your delts. Allow the bar to come to a full and complete stop here while you take in another full breath of air and begin another rep. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, of course, I think both the seated and the standing dumbbell shoulder press make for reasonable alternatives or additions here, since including isolateral movements can help prevent muscle imbalances and asymmetries. The seated variation will allow for the use of heavier loads; however, the standing variation will increase stabilization demands, meaning more core and side delt activation. Unlike with the barbell press, here you can just press the dumbbells straight up with the dumbbells more out to the sides, as you don't need to worry about smashing your face on the way up. For the dumbbell variations, I prefer slightly higher reps, usually in the 8 to 15 rep zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say the most common error that I see here is just not using a full range of motion. Similar to the pull-up, many people will cut the range of motion short at the top and the bottom, not going to full lockout and also not touching the chest at the bottom. Keeping your range of motion consistent will ensure you're actually gaining strength through progressive overload, not progressive decreases in range of motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although not inherently problematic or injurious, I consider doing touch-and-go reps as another error here, since they're going to create more inconsistent reps and often lead to bouncy reps with lots of momentum and reliance on that stretch reflex at the bottom. If any of this gets too excessive, I think it really can hinder your true brute pressing strength required to get that bar moving from a dead stop. A third error that I see here all the time is not flexing the glutes. Like I said, the goal of this exercise is to press the bar as vertically as you comfortably can, and keeping your glutes relaxed will usually result in the hips being back behind the bar, which reduces stability and more often than not results in the bar being pressed forward rather than straight up. This is a bad habit and it can put a lot of strain on your lower back and create more inconsistency in both your bar path and just form in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so that's all I have for the overhead press, guys. Now before you click out of this one, I've just got a quick rundown of what I have planned for the next few Technique Tuesday episodes. You guys may have noticed that I've been skipping leg day so far in the series. So, for the next three episodes, we're going to hit three different lower body exercises, starting with the squat next week. I should say here that there is no real underlying method or meaning to the order in which I'm covering these exercises. I'm obviously trying to focus on exercises that I think are smart to include in your program, but I'm trying to space out the more time-consuming and longer videos like the squat, bench press, and deadlift so I don't burn out too quickly on the production from the beginning. All those videos are coming, and I have the whole series mapped out until about mid-June as of now.\n",

      "Okay, welcome everyone to the first episode of Technique Tuesday, where every week we're going to take an in-depth look at the lost art and science of training techniques. Just as a quick general outline, for the most part, we're going to break each exercise up into four sections. We’ll look at the muscles we’re targeting, how to set up for the exercise, the execution of the movement, and then common errors that many people make. Without further ado, let's jump right into it with the bench press exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The muscles we'll be targeting here, in order of involvement, are the pec major—both the sternal (mid and lower) and clavicular (upper) heads—the triceps brachii, the anterior (front) deltoid, and, to a lesser extent, the lats. However, they’ll only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso (at the very bottom of the press). The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction (mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids), some degree of shoulder flexion (carried out by the upper pecs and front delt), and elbow extension (mainly handled by the triceps).\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into the full setup, I think it's important to emphasize that you should only compare your bench strength to your starting place, not anyone else's. There are just so many extraneous factors that can contribute to performance on this lift, like your arm length, ribcage size, muscle origins and insertions, lumbar spine mobility, the size and strength of your upper back (for creating a stable base of support), and on and on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup on the bench press is extremely important, so you may want to play this back a couple of times. What I’m going to go through first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons I've explained in other videos related to maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I still think this style of bench press is a great mass builder for anyone with the primary goal of building size. I’ll explain some variations you can make if you have purely bodybuilding interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we go. First, you want to double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the middle of the rack, and that you have a spotter handy if you're training at high efforts. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar, your feet up on the bench, and squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the whole setup and execution of the lift. Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the uprights of the bench. Personally, I prefer to grab the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lift your hips up high while thinking about pulling your shoulder blades to your butt, which will help force you into scapular depression and push your upper body forward. Keep your feet in place, but you can go up on your toes if you find you can get more arch that way. At this point, your back should be planted on the bench, and your eyes should be directly under the barbell. Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench. When viewed from the front, if using a regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may need to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out to get your heels down. Also, make sure you've dropped your hips down so that your butt is touching the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take your grip. At this point, I widen my grip, which is definitely on the wider side since I'm simply stronger with a wider grip. It's worth noting that research has found that wider grips will target the sternal head of the pecs and the anterior delts more, while a closer grip will target the triceps and clavicular or upper chest more. It makes sense to use a variety of grip widths in training or experiment and find what works best for you. However, an important factor in determining grip width should be whether or not your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's also worth noting that some advanced powerlifters won’t always keep the joints perfectly stacked so they can get out wider. In any case, a 2007 study suggests that a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance, so roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width, is optimal for reducing injury without seriously compromising maximal strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important point regarding grip is to make sure you have your wrist joints stacked, meaning from the side view, your wrist should be directly below your knuckles. You want to avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and you can correct this by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue. Right before the lift-off, I do one last check to make sure my shoulder blades are retracted and depressed by cranking my elbows forward, which I think of as me sort of screwing my back into position.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those strictly interested in bodybuilding, the same general setup can still apply; however, you won’t need as extreme of an arch. You may want to take a slightly more narrow grip to increase the range of motion, and because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a little further forward. But still, for the sake of shoulder health and stability, you’ll want to keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine. I think people tend to exaggerate the difference in range of motion between a big arch and a small arch. It’s worth noting that the distance traveled by the bar isn’t necessarily the same as joint range of motion. Comparing the joint angles in these two bench press styles, the position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is actually very similar, despite the fact that the bar will have traveled further in the flat-back press. Therefore, you should get to work on building your arch and just not worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we’ve got the bench press setup, and now it’s time to actually execute the set. We’re going to break down the execution into four distinct phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unrack**: Have your spotter help you lift out, not up, or if you’re un-racking by yourself, you may want to keep your butt elevated for the lift-off component, then drop your hips down once you’ve un-racked. I personally prefer to have a spotter handy whenever approaching a maximal effort to help with the lift-off. At this point, you want to ensure you have four main points of contact: your head, upper back, glutes, and feet should all be planted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Brace**: Take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt (if you have one). You can also cue yourself to puff your chest out at this point to expand your ribcage as much as possible. Grip the bar as hard as you can, and you can use the optional cue to bend the bar or rip the bar in half, which will activate your upper back muscles to help maintain tightness during the descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Descend**: Drop your elbows down at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso when viewed from the top. There is unanimous agreement on this from the best powerlifting coaches. When viewed from the side, the elbows shouldn't be too far out in front of the bar. Make it a goal to keep the elbow stacked under the bar. The descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. Touch your chest just below nipple level toward the bottom of your sternum, which should be the highest contact point on your chest. Optionally, pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless. This is required for competitive powerlifting, but if you’re purely bodybuilding, you can simply tap your chest without a pause. Just ensure the touch is well controlled and you’re not bouncing the weight off your chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Press**: After your optional pause, explode the bar off your chest, driving your heels into the floor. Think about pressing the bar back toward your face and off your chest rather than just driving the bar straight up. Think about pushing the floor away from you with your feet to help initiate that leg drive and enforce this back-and-up bar path. Of course, you don’t want to press the bar too far back so that it hits the rack or you lose control. Bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring the starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way up, you’re likely to encounter a sticking point if training at high efforts, where the lift will feel most difficult. It’s likely where you’ll fail the lift if going for a max effort set. Our research shows that it tends to be in the first 20 to 40% of the movement, about 3 to 4 inches off the chest, but that will be individual. Typically, the more advanced you are, the lower the sticking point will be; the newer you are, the more it’ll be in the mid-range. To break through the sticking point, make sure you’re pressing the bar up and back, not just straight up. You can also try flaring the elbows out a bit more, as this will get your pecs more involved to help the triceps. Think about lifting the bar off your chest with max speed to help you blast through that point where deceleration would normally happen. Personally, the simplest solution is that you probably just need stronger pecs and triceps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’re accelerating past the sticking point, you have the option to exhale, but you can hold your breath until you completely lock the lift out. As you near the end range of motion, the bar should complete that arc back toward the starting position, with the bar back over the nipples. At this point, repeat the process starting with bracing, descending, and pressing again for however many reps your program calls for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three common errors I see all the time with the bench press are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Over-tucking or under-tucking the elbows**: The cue to tuck your elbows originated in equipped powerlifting, but without a bench shirt, this cue probably won’t be as helpful. It's probably just as common to see people not tucking enough, completely flaring their elbows out to be parallel with the bar. I think this also isn’t ideal, as it puts your shoulder at an increased risk of injury and makes the bar path much less efficient since the bar is forced to go straight up and down. Most people simply won’t be as strong benching with completely flared elbows. Like I said earlier, a slight tuck is good. However, as you get to that sticking point, more of a flare might help you get the elbows more stacked under the bar and allow you to finish up the lift. If you have difficulty figuring out how you’re using your elbows, I’d recommend doing slow eccentric presses with lighter weights, being mindful of where your elbows are and where they’re going.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Benching with a completely flat back**: You may not need quite as extreme of an arch as a competitive powerlifter. However, maintaining some arch in your spine confers at least three major benefits. First, the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs are actually safer in a lordotic or arched position. The more decline pushing angle is safer for the shoulder joint, and you’ll most likely be simply stronger in this position, meaning more total load is going to be placed on the active muscle groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lack of leg drive**: If your feet are just positioned wherever or just out in front of you on the bench rather than tucked in behind you, you’re not maximizing your strength potential on the bench press. Figuring out how to use your legs in the bench press may take time, but I think it’s really important to master. I've linked a few really good articles in the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside this video, I’m releasing my bench press specialization program. Like most of my programs, this is more of a bench press training manual and covers way more detail than I had time to touch on in this video. It comes with an eight-week training program designed for intermediate to advanced lifters with the goal of increasing strength on their bench press. It’s actually more than just a bench program; it’s an upper/lower training split that’ll have you in the gym five days per week and has a specific focus on developing bench strength, with that exercise hit three times per week using daily undulating periodization. The program is $29.99, but if you use the discount code \"TechniqueTuesday,\" you’ll be able to save 10 bucks off the program, knocking it down to $19.99 for the first week of launch. You can learn more about that over on my website at jeffnippard.com or click the first link in the description.\n",

We’ll look at the muscles we’re targeting, how to set up for the exercise, the execution of the movement, and then common errors that many people make.

However, they’ll only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso (at the very bottom of the press). The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction (mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids), some degree of shoulder flexion (carried out by the upper pecs and front delt), and elbow extension (mainly handled by the triceps).\"),\n",

What I’m going to go through first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons I've explained in other videos related to maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I still think this style of bench press is a great mass builder for anyone with the primary goal of building size.

Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the uprights of the bench.

Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench. When viewed from the front, if using a regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may need to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out to get your heels down. Also, make sure you've dropped your hips down so that your butt is touching the bench.\"),\n",

At this point, I widen my grip, which is definitely on the wider side since I'm simply stronger with a wider grip. It's worth noting that research has found that wider grips will target the sternal head of the pecs and the anterior delts more, while a closer grip will target the triceps and clavicular or upper chest more. It makes sense to use a variety of grip widths in training or experiment and find what works best for you. However, an important factor in determining grip width should be whether or not your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's also worth noting that some advanced powerlifters won’t always keep the joints perfectly stacked so they can get out wider. In any case, a 2007 study suggests that a max width of 1.5 times the acromial distance, so roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width, is optimal for reducing injury without seriously compromising maximal strength.\"),\n",

You want to avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and you can correct this by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue.

You may want to take a slightly more narrow grip to increase the range of motion, and because your arch will be smaller, your feet can be a little further forward. But still, for the sake of shoulder health and stability, you’ll want to keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine. I think people tend to exaggerate the difference in range of motion between a big arch and a small arch. It’s worth noting that the distance traveled by the bar isn’t necessarily the same as joint range of motion. Comparing the joint angles in these two bench press styles, the position of the humerus relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is actually very similar, despite the fact that the bar will have traveled further in the flat-back press.

      "Okay, welcome, everyone, to a new episode of Technique Tuesday. This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the squat with perfect technique. The back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises and even the king of all exercises, and that's a title I think it actually deserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we jump into the technique for this exercise, let's take a look at what muscles we're going to be targeting with this movement first. With the squat, we're training simultaneous hip extension, where the hips straighten out on the way up, and knee extension, where the knees straighten out. The hip extension component will be handled primarily by the glutes, getting some assistance from the adductor magnus. Even though the hamstrings can perform hip extension, they actually don't contribute much to the squat at all because of the bent knee, meaning their muscle length doesn't change much throughout the range of motion. The knee extension component will be handled by the quadriceps, and we'll be performing an isometric lumbar extension contraction, which will be handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, another very common misconception is that the abs are highly active in the squat, but that simply isn't true. EMG data shows low abdominal activity in the squat, which makes sense given that their function is spinal flexion and anti-extension, neither of which occur in the squat. So, we're mainly looking at the glutes, quads, and spinal erectors as the muscular targets of the squat. Because the squat involves multiple joints and large muscle masses, it's very conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep zone. While there are exceptions, doing squats for greater than 10 reps or so will usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature, leading to sloppy form, worse strength gains, and lower muscle activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, I recommend loading the squat with at least seventy percent of your one rep max or in the five to ten rep zone if your goal is primarily hypertrophy, and the three to six rep zone if your goal is primarily strength. Again, there will be exceptions to this. It's important to be very objective about where your form stands and possibly consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique. Then you can build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible will be far better than taking a few months off due to an injury from lifting beyond your capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before approaching the bar, do a quick check to make sure you have the right weight on both sides and that the bar is centered in the rack. You want to position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar, you aren't hitting the j-hooks during the walkout. For most, bar positions around armpit height will be a good height.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reasons I've discussed in another video, which I'll link below, I think people actually exaggerate the practical difference between a high bar squat, with the bar resting up on your traps, and a low bar squat, with the bar resting down on your rear delts. Research shows that ultimately, the high bar squat may be a bit more quad dominant, and the low bar squat may be a bit more hip dominant. In my experience, I think the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and tends to feel a bit more comfortable for many people. So, we'll be squatting with the high bar position here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward, and it's too low if it feels like it's going to slide down your back. You want to position your hands as comfortably close to your shoulders as possible. A closer grip here will activate the muscles of the upper back better, leading to a more stable base of support for the bar. Your hands should merely be stabilizing the bar, keeping it mashed between your palms and your upper back. You shouldn't be actively gripping the bar like you would in a bench press; just let it really sit and settle in there on your upper back.\n",
      "\n",
      "With both feet underneath the bar, you want to push your hips forward to unrack the bar. Don't make the common mistake of squatting the bar up with your knees, as this will cause unnecessary quad fatigue before the actual lift itself and can contribute to knee pain. You want to take three steps backward: one small step with your non-dominant leg, one medium step with the other leg, and then a third mini step to get your feet even. Once your feet are set, they should be planted with about a 15 to 30-degree foot flare. In general, you just want to make sure that your feet are at least wider than shoulder-width.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you've got the squat set up, it's time to actually execute the lift. We're going to split this up into three distinct phases: brace, descend, and lift. For the bracing phase, your heel and big toe should be making even pressure on the ground, and your weight should be centered on the middle of your foot. I don't really like the cue to keep your weight on your heels since it can throw your balance off and cause your hips to shoot up early. You really want to have your weight evenly distributed across the entire foot. Your head should be slightly extended, with your eyes gazing straight ahead, and your elbows should be pointing slightly back. Try not to position them directly under the bar, which can lead to elbow pain. You want to pull a huge breath of air deep into your diaphragm, pushing your gut out against your belt to create a solid, rigid column down your spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you're fully braced and ready to begin the descent. For the high bar position, you want to break at the hips and the knees at the same time. Just looking at the knees first here, you want to push your knees forward and slightly out so that they track in the same direction as your toes while at the same time sitting your hips straight down. You should be pushing through your heel, big toe, and pinky toe throughout the eccentric, keeping an even weight distribution through your feet. When viewed from the side, the bar path should be a perfectly straight line moving straight down, centered directly over the middle of the foot. You want to lower the bar under control, actively driving your upper back into the bar, and not allowing your chest to fall forward. You don't want to descend excessively slowly, to the point where you start to lose gas too early. Generally, you only want about a one-second negative on the squat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to squat depth, I recommend at least squatting parallel to the ground as a minimum standard for hypertrophy and general strength. However, for regulation technique, you technically do need to get the hip crease below the knee joint, meaning you will have to go below parallel. I think most people should be able to squat to this depth when using a high bar position and with the appropriate stance width for particular skeleton and mobility. This position is what we call \"being in the hole.\" Unless you're doing paused squats as a specific training drill, you generally don't want to pause in the hole at all but rather take advantage of the stretch reflex at the bottom and then immediately reverse the motion the second you hit depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although you want to maintain an erect, upright posture during the positive, I'm not a big fan of the \"chest up\" cue myself since it can cause some trainees to lean too far backward. I prefer to think about driving your back up into the bar while keeping your head slightly up, which is going to pull the spine into a good lifting position. Remember that with the squat, we're trying to move heavy weight and maximize our strength potential, so don't worry about squeezing any muscles or feeling the burn or anything like that. You want to explode out of the hole as if you were trying to jump through the ceiling. I personally keep my breath held until about two-thirds of the way up, at which point I exhale. Once I'm back up to the top, I'll begin the bracing phase again, take another deep breath in, and then repeat for however many reps my program calls for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are so many errors with the squat, I may have to just do another video on just the mistakes alone. I did actually do one myth-busting video explaining why you should actually let your knees come forward past the toes and why the cue to keep your knees behind the toes can actually be harmful to the lower back, and I'll link that in the description below. Other than that, I would say one really common error that I see is knee valgus, or having the knees cave in, either on the negative or the positive. This usually stems from a lack of proper hip external rotation, so you want to make sure your feet are adequately flared out, which will help. Then you want to actively think about driving your knees out in the direction of your toes, but not excessively beyond the direction of your toes. Simply placing a mini band or hip circle around your knees can help to cue for this and strengthen the hip abductors. Wearing a heeled squat shoe can also help. Harrison's foot pronation or losing your arch is a known contributor to knee valgus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two common errors usually come as a two-for-one deal here: going too heavy and not going deep enough. The squat, unlike, say, the deadlift, starts with the eccentric phase, so it's easier to cheat by loading up the bar with more weight than you can handle and then only going halfway down. Whereas, on a deadlift, if you can't lift the weight, it just stays where it is on the ground, so it's a little bit harder to cheat on that one. You also want to be careful with \"butt wink\" or lower back rounding here. If your back is excessively rounding on the squat, you may want to start cutting your depth a bit shorter or just modify your stance width, either more or less wide. However, I think that some degree of butt wink is basically an inevitability for many lifters and isn't a cause for too much concern, especially if it's mild and isn't causing any pain or discomfort. Foam rolling and dynamic stretching before squatting will also increase joint range of motion acutely and may help reduce butt wink as you hit depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can't squat due to injury, which I think really is the only reason you shouldn't be squatting, the first thing I'd recommend is some kind of machine or hack squat or even a smith machine squat if you find that to be more comfortable. Lunges are great as well but won't have that same overloading potential as the squat will. As a last resort, I'd say a leg press plus a lower back extension captures a decent amount of what the squat is training.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is all that I have for the squat. Before you guys click out of the video just yet, I want to let you know I just launched a new squat program on my website. It's a 10-week program, and it has some squat variation hit four times per week, with volume tapering down to a new one rep max test in week 10. I would say that if you've been trying to get your squat up, there's absolutely no way that this program won't increase your squat max. If you do run it for the 10 weeks and you don't set a new PR, just send me an email, and I'll send you a full refund for the program. I'm launching this program for just $12.99 for this week, and it's going to go up to $19.99 after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give you some idea here, this is week one, day one. You have all the squat work and then all the lower body accessory work programmed in for you, plus coaching notes from me. The upper body work is flexible, so you should be able to really easily fit this squat routine into your current routine. I do give some guidance on how you can set that up with different splits.

This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the squat with perfect technique. The back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises and even the king of all exercises, and that's a title I think it actually deserves.\"),\n",

With the squat, we're training simultaneous hip extension, where the hips straighten out on the way up, and knee extension, where the knees straighten out. The hip extension component will be handled primarily by the glutes, getting some assistance from the adductor magnus. Even though the hamstrings can perform hip extension, they actually don't contribute much to the squat at all because of the bent knee, meaning their muscle length doesn't change much throughout the range of motion. The knee extension component will be handled by the quadriceps, and we'll be performing an isometric lumbar extension contraction, which will be handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back.\"),\n",

EMG data shows low abdominal activity in the squat, which makes sense given that their function is spinal flexion and anti-extension, neither of which occur in the squat. So, we're mainly looking at the glutes, quads, and spinal erectors as the muscular targets of the squat. Because the squat involves multiple joints and large muscle masses, it's very conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep zone. While there are exceptions, doing squats for greater than 10 reps or so will usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature, leading to sloppy form, worse strength gains, and lower muscle activation.\"),\n",

Again, there will be exceptions to this. It's important to be very objective about where your form stands and possibly consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique. Then you can build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible will be far better than taking a few months off due to an injury from lifting beyond your capability.\\n\\nBefore approaching the bar, do a quick check to make sure you have the right weight on both sides and that the bar is centered in the rack.

Research shows that ultimately, the high bar squat may be a bit more quad dominant, and the low bar squat may be a bit more hip dominant. In my experience, I think the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and tends to feel a bit more comfortable for many people. So, we'll be squatting with the high bar position here.\"),\n",

You want to position your hands as comfortably close to your shoulders as possible. A closer grip here will activate the muscles of the upper back better, leading to a more stable base of support for the bar. Your hands should merely be stabilizing the bar, keeping it mashed between your palms and your upper back. You shouldn't be actively gripping the bar like you would in a bench press; just let it really sit and settle in there on your upper back.\"),\n",

Don't make the common mistake of squatting the bar up with your knees, as this will cause unnecessary quad fatigue before the actual lift itself and can contribute to knee pain. You want to take three steps backward: one small step with your non-dominant leg, one medium step with the other leg, and then a third mini step to get your feet even. Once your feet are set, they should be planted with about a 15 to 30-degree foot flare. In general, you just want to make sure that your feet are at least wider than shoulder-width.\"),\n",

We're going to split this up into three distinct phases: brace, descend, and lift. For the bracing phase, your heel and big toe should be making even pressure on the ground, and your weight should be centered on the middle of your foot. I don't really like the cue to keep your weight on your heels since it can throw your balance off and cause your hips to shoot up early. You really want to have your weight evenly distributed across the entire foot. Your head should be slightly extended, with your eyes gazing straight ahead, and your elbows should be pointing slightly back. Try not to position them directly under the bar, which can lead to elbow pain.

It makes sense to use a variety of grip widths in training or experiment and find what works best for you. However, an important factor in determining grip width should be whether or not your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's also worth noting that some advanced powerlifters won’t always keep the joints perfectly stacked so they can get out wider.

This is going to increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity as you press. While holding your breath, press the bar straight up—not up and forward or up and backward—so when viewed from the side, the bar should be traveling up in a pretty much straight line. To keep the bar from hitting your chin, you'll have to slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press, then as you clear your face, push your head forward back to a neutral position.\"),\n",

Meaning from the side position, the bar should be resting above the wrist joint, not behind the wrist joint near the fingers. You want to externally rotate your shoulders, pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45-degree angle. You don't want them flared too much out to the sides, which can cause shoulder pain, and you don't want them straight in front of the shoulders, which will limit your strength potential.\")]"

      "Keeping your back flat during squats is crucial for maintaining proper form and preventing injury. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Setup Correctly:** Before you begin the squat, ensure that your feet are shoulder-width apart and your toes are slightly pointed outwards. This will give you a stable base to work from.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Engage Your Core:** During the bracing phase, focus on pulling a deep breath into your diaphragm and engaging your core by pushing your abdominal muscles out against a belt or against your own body if not wearing a belt. This helps create a strong, stable spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Bar Positioning:** Position the barbell correctly on your upper back. The bar should rest comfortably on your traps (high bar position) or just below them on your rear delts (low bar position), depending on your comfort and style.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Maintain a Neutral Spine:** Keep your head slightly extended with your eyes pointing straight ahead to encourage a neutral spine. Avoid looking up or down, which can alter your back positioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hip Hinge Movement:** When you start the squat, initiate the movement by pushing your hips back as if you're sitting into a chair, rather than bending your knees first. This helps maintain a flat back and engages the posterior chain effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Control Your Descent:** Lower yourself in a controlled manner, keeping your chest up and back straight throughout the descent. Imagine your back as a plank, staying rigid from your head to your tailbone.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Use Your Whole Foot:** Keep your weight distributed evenly across your entire foot, from heel to toe, as mentioned in the bracing phase. This balance helps maintain proper posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Practice Mobility:** Work on improving your hip and ankle mobility, as flexibility in these areas allows you to maintain better form throughout the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, practicing with lighter weights initially can help you focus on form and reinforce good habits before progressing to heavier loads.\n"
