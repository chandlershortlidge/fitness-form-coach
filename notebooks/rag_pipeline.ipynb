This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the overhead barbell press, or OHP, with perfect technique. With this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion, basically lifting your arm up overhead, which will be handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We'll also be performing elbow extension, which will hit all three heads of the triceps, and when viewed from the back, you can see that there will be scapular upward rotation occurring, handled by the upper traps. I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, although it usually does take longer to gain strength on than other exercises, so be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a huge range of motion, nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. However,\")]\n"

However, if you're working inside a correctly set up power rack, a spotter is not absolutely necessary. Start with an empty bar. Lie down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this position, you should be far enough down from the bar—meaning toward the foot end of the bench—that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the downside of the bar. Your feet should be flat on the ground with your shins approximately vertical. Your upper back should be flat against the bench with your lower back in an anatomically normal arched position. Take an overhand grip on the bar; your grip should be somewhere between 22 and 24 inches measured between the index fingers. This grip width will result in a vertical forearm for most people when the bar is touching the chest at the bottom.

Muscle and strength are my pursuits. I'm the powerlifter, bodybuilder, scientist, and coach. I'm Layne Norton. I am a physique architect. The bench press is one of the most important upper body exercises. This makes it crucial for overall development and strength. A lot of people think about it as just a chest movement, but it incorporates the pectorals, the triceps, the shoulders, and even the back when done correctly. When it's done wrong, the results can be disastrous. Seven years ago, I tore my right pectoral bench pressing incorrectly. But over time, I learned to incorporate more muscle groups and focus on the movement itself. Not only did it become more safe, but my results were better. In this video, I'm going to teach you things I learned from top technique experts like Ben Escrow, Dr. Mike Zourdos, and Matt Gary to make my bench press more effective, safe, and fun.\")]\n"

But before we get started, if you’ve been enjoying my Golden Rule series, be sure to smash that like and subscribe button, and let me know which exercise you want to see next down in the comment section below. Alright, guys, golden rule number one: you always want to make sure you’re benching with a grip just outside shoulder width. I know some of you are going to say that with a wider grip you can bench more weight, but when you have a wider grip on this exercise using a barbell, you’re not going to get much of a squeeze at the top of the movement. It should go without saying: the more you bring your hands in, the more of a squeeze you get in your chest—adduction is one of the functions of the chest—which means if you’re feeling that squeeze at the top, you’re going to get more muscle activation, more muscle damage, and')]\n"
