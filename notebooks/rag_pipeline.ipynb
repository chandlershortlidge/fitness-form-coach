      "Welcome, everyone, to a new episode of Technique Tuesday! This week, we're going to look at how to perform the overhead barbell press or OHP with perfect technique. In this movement, we're performing shoulder flexion—basically, lifting your arm overhead—which is handled by the anterior or front deltoid and, to a lesser degree, the clavicular or upper head of the pecs. We will also perform elbow extension, targeting all three heads of the triceps, and from the back view, you'll see scapular upward rotation, managed by the upper traps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the overhead press for two main reasons. First, being a basic multi-joint barbell movement, it allows for a good deal of progressive overload, though it usually takes longer to gain strength than other exercises, so be patient. Second, it is a great general strength-building exercise that goes through a large range of motion—nearly 180 degrees of shoulder flexion.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is one thing I don't love about the overhead press: it is quite front deltoid dominant. A 2013 study comparing four shoulder press variations found that dumbbell presses were better than barbell presses for targeting the side delts, and standing presses (as opposed to sitting) were better for the side delts in both cases. So, if growing the side delt is your main goal, in addition to lateral raises, you might want to include dumbbell presses. However, the range of motion might be shorter, especially as you go heavier, since the bulky head of the dumbbell might hit your shoulders on the way down, ending the range of motion. In practice, I think it's smart to combine and periodically vary exercises. While it isn't perfect on its own, I still like the overhead press as a core, fundamental vertical pressing movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the OHP involves multiple joints and uses a large range of motion, it should generally be loaded with moderate to heavy weight, somewhere in the 5 to 10 rep range. Set up the bar in a squat rack at the same height you would for a squat, around armpit height. Unrack the weight by gripping the bar with a slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip, so your hands are just outside your shoulders. Get your elbows underneath the bar, slightly bend your knees and hips, and stand up straight, lifting the bar off the rack. Take two to three steps back and firmly plant your feet with a roughly shoulder-width stance and a slight 15-degree foot flare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Point your elbows slightly outside your shoulders—this will be your starting position. Although I wouldn't recommend a thumbless (or \"suicide\") grip for beginners, more experienced lifters can use it as long as the wrists are stacked, meaning the bar should rest above the wrist joint, not behind the wrist joint near the fingers. Externally rotate your shoulders, pushing the elbows slightly out at about a 45-degree angle. Avoid flaring them too much to the sides, which can cause shoulder pain, or keeping them straight in front of the shoulders, which limits strength potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the bar resting on your upper chest or collarbone area, flex your glutes to ensure a neutral spine and take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt, if you have one, to increase intra-abdominal pressure and torso rigidity as you press. While holding your breath, press the bar straight up, not forward or backward. From the side, the bar should travel in a straight line. To avoid hitting your chin, slightly tilt your head back as you initiate the press, then, after clearing your face, push your head forward to a neutral position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the concentric phase, keep your knees, hips, and shoulder blades motionless. A common error is shrugging your shoulders up to initiate the concentric off the chest, which makes the movement easier short-term but can weaken your bottom-end concentric pressing ability and limit your true max strength potential long-term. Press the bar all the way up until your elbows lock out, with the bar overhead centered over the shoulder joint. At the end of the range of motion, there should be a straight line connecting the barbell, shoulders, hips, and the middle of the foot. This maintains balance and prevents excessive forward or backward weight shifting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start the eccentric by dropping your elbows down and to the side at a 45-degree angle, not straight down in front of your delts. Allow the bar to come to a full and complete stop while you take another full breath of air and begin another rep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the seated and standing dumbbell shoulder press make for reasonable alternatives or additions. Including isolateral movements can help prevent muscle imbalances and asymmetries. The seated variation allows for heavier loads, while the standing variation increases stabilization demands, leading to more core and side delt activation. Unlike the barbell press, you can press the dumbbells straight up with them more out to the sides, as you don't need to worry about hitting your face on the way up. For the dumbbell variations, I prefer slightly higher reps, usually in the 8 to 15 rep range.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common error here is not using a full range of motion. Similar to the pull-up, many people cut the range of motion short at the top and bottom, not locking out or touching the chest. Keeping your range of motion consistent ensures you're gaining strength through progressive overload, not progressive decreases in range of motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though not inherently problematic or injurious, I consider doing touch-and-go reps an error since they create inconsistent reps and often lead to bouncy reps with lots of momentum, relying on the stretch reflex at the bottom. Excessive reliance can hinder your true brute pressing strength needed to move the bar from a dead stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third common error is not flexing the glutes. The goal is to press the bar as vertically as you can comfortably and keeping your glutes relaxed often results in the hips being back behind the bar, reducing stability and often leading to the bar being pressed forward rather than straight up. This is a bad habit that can strain your lower back and create inconsistency in bar path and form.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I have for the overhead press, guys. Before you go, here's a quick rundown of what's planned for the next few Technique Tuesday episodes. You may have noticed I've skipped leg day so far in the series. For the next three episodes, we'll cover three different lower body exercises, starting with the squat next week. There's no real underlying method or meaning to the order I'm covering these exercises. I'm focusing on exercises I think are smart to include in your program, spacing out the more time-consuming and longer videos like the squat, bench press, and deadlift, so I don't burn out on production too quickly.\n",

      "Okay, welcome everyone to the first episode of Technique Tuesday, where every week we're going to take an in-depth look at the lost art and science of training technique. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just as a general outline, for the most part, we're going to break each exercise into four sections: the muscles we're targeting, how to set up for the exercise, execution of the movement, and common errors that many people make. \n",
      "\n",
      "Without further ado, let's jump right into it with the bench press exercise. The muscles we'll be targeting here, in order of involvement, are the pec major (both the sternal/mid and lower, and clavicular/upper heads), the triceps brachii, the anterior (front) deltoid, and to a lesser extent the lats. The lats will only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, which occurs only at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids, some degree of shoulder flexion carried out by the upper pecs and front delt, and elbow extension predominantly handled by the triceps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into the full setup, it's important to emphasize that you should only compare your bench strength to your starting place, not to anyone else's, because many extraneous factors contribute to performance on this lift, like your arm length, ribcage size, muscle origins, insertions, lumbar spine mobility, and the size and strength of your upper back for creating a stable base of support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting up the bench press is extremely important, and you may want to play this section back a couple of times. What I'm going to explain first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons explained in other videos regarding maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I think this bench press style is a great mass builder, even for those whose primary goal is building size. I'll describe some modifications if your interests are purely bodybuilding-oriented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we go. First, double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the middle of the rack, and that you have a spotter handy for high-effort training. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar, feet up on the bench, and squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the whole setup and execution of the lift. Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the bench uprights, though I prefer to grab the bar. Lift your hips up high while thinking about pulling your shoulder blades toward your butt, which will help force you into scapular depression and push your upper body forward while keeping your feet in place. You can go up onto your toes if you find you can achieve a greater arch that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, your back should be planted on the bench, and your eyes should be directly under the barbell. Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench when viewed from the front. In regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may have to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out to get your heels down. Also, make sure to drop your hips so that your butt is touching the bench. Take your grip; I widen my grip since I'm stronger with a wider grip. It's worth noting that wider grips target the sternal head of the pecs and anterior delts more, while a closer grip will target the triceps and clavicular (upper chest) more. Using a variety of grip widths in training or experimenting to find what works best for you makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important factor in determining grip width is whether your joints are stacked from the rear position, meaning the wrist should be roughly positioned over the elbows. It's also worth noting that some advanced powerlifters won't always keep joints perfectly stacked to get out wider, but a 2007 study suggests that a maximum width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) reduces injury risk without seriously compromising maximal strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding grip, ensure your wrist joints are stacked, meaning from the side view, your wrist should be directly below your knuckles. Avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and correct it by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right before the lift-off, do a last check to ensure your shoulder blades are retracted and depressed by cranking your elbows forward, which I think of as screwing my back into position. For those strictly interested in bodybuilding, the same general setup applies. However, you won't need as extreme of an arch. You may want to take a slightly narrower grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch is smaller, your feet can be a little further forward, but for shoulder health and stability, keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important not to exaggerate the difference in the range of motion between a big arch and a small arch. The bar's distance traveled isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles: the humerus's position relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is very similar despite the bar traveling further in a flat back press. Work on building your arch and don't worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've covered the bench press setup, it's time to execute the set, broken into four phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unrack:** Have your spotter help you lift out, not up. If un-racking by yourself, you may elevate your butt for the lift-off and then drop your hips down once un-racked. I prefer having a spotter whenever going near a maximal effort to assist with the lift-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Brace:** Ensure four main points of contact: head, upper back, glutes, and feet are all planted. Take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one. Cue yourself to puff your chest out to expand your ribcage as much as possible, grip the bar as hard as you can, and optionally use the cue to bend or rip the bar in half to activate your upper back muscles and maintain tightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Descend:** Drop your elbows down at a 45-degree angle relative to your torso when viewed from the top. From the side, the elbows shouldn't be far out in front of the bar; aim to keep the elbows stacked under the bar, and the descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. Touch your chest just below nipple level toward the bottom of your sternum, the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, required for competitive powerlifting. If purely bodybuilding, simply tap your chest without a pause but ensure controlled touches, not bouncing the weight off your chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Press:** After the optional pause, explode the bar off your chest, driving your heels into the floor. Think about pressing the bar back toward your face, off your chest, rather than straight up. Think about pushing the floor away with your feet to help initiate leg drive and enforce the back-and-up bar path. Avoid pressing the bar too far back to hit the rack or lose control; bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring the starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the ascent, you'll likely hit a sticking point if training at high efforts where the lift feels most difficult, typically in the first 20 to 40% of the movement. Research shows it tends to be 3 to 4 inches off the chest, though it varies individually. Advanced lifters have a lower sticking point, while newer ones have a mid-range one. To break through, press the bar up and back, not just straight up. Try flaring the elbows more to involve the pecs. Think about lifting the bar with max speed to blast through where deceleration would occur. Generally, stronger pecs and triceps can help. Once accelerating past the sticking point, you can exhale or hold your breath until completely locking out. The bar should arc back toward the starting position, over the nipples, and then repeat the process of bracing, descending, and pressing for the required reps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three common errors with the bench press are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Over- or Under-tucking Elbows:** The cue to tuck elbows originated in equipped powerlifting. Without a bench shirt, it’s less helpful. Many don’t tuck enough, flaring elbows parallel to the bar, which risks injury and creates inefficient bar paths. A slight tuck is good, and as you hit that sticking point, flaring to stack elbows under the bar may help complete the lift. If elbow control is challenging, do slow eccentric presses with lighter weights, mindful of elbow position.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Benching with a Flat Back:** You may not need a powerlifter's extreme arch, but maintaining some arch benefits you by safer positioning for lumbar/thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs, a safer shoulder joint due to the decline pushing angle, and generally being stronger, so more load on active muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lack of Leg Drive:** If feet are just positioned wherever or on the bench rather than tucked behind, you’re not maximizing bench press strength potential. Leg use in the bench press may take time to master, but it's important to learn. I’ve linked some good articles for reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside this video, I'm releasing my Bench Press Specialization Program.

The muscles we'll be targeting here, in order of involvement, are the pec major (both the sternal/mid and lower, and clavicular/upper heads), the triceps brachii, the anterior (front) deltoid, and to a lesser extent the lats. The lats will only be active when the shoulder is behind the torso, which occurs only at the very bottom of the press. The primary actions being trained are horizontal shoulder adduction, mainly by the pecs and anterior deltoids, some degree of shoulder flexion carried out by the upper pecs and front delt, and elbow extension predominantly handled by the triceps.\"),\n",

What I'm going to explain first is technically a strength-focused, powerlifting-style bench press. However, for reasons explained in other videos regarding maximizing load, minimizing injury risk, and optimizing overall pec recruitment, I think this bench press style is a great mass builder, even for those whose primary goal is building size. I'll describe some modifications if your interests are purely bodybuilding-oriented.\"),\n",

First, double-check that you have the right weight on both sides, that the bar is centered in the middle of the rack, and that you have a spotter handy for high-effort training. Lie flat on the bench with your head back behind the bar, feet up on the bench, and squeeze your shoulder blades together, keeping them in this retracted position throughout the whole setup and execution of the lift. Set up your arch by lifting your arms up and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip, or you can reach back and push against the bench uprights, though I prefer to grab the bar. Lift your hips up high while thinking about pulling your shoulder blades toward your butt, which will help force you into scapular depression and push your upper body forward while keeping your feet in place. You can go up onto your toes if you find you can achieve a greater arch that way.'),\n",

Position your lower body for leg drive by lowering one foot at a time, positioning your feet as far back as you comfortably can, and keeping your legs close to the bench when viewed from the front. In regulation technique, your heels should be planted on the ground, so you may have to externally rotate your feet or point your toes out to get your heels down. Also, make sure to drop your hips so that your butt is touching the bench. Take your grip; I widen my grip since I'm stronger with a wider grip. It's worth noting that wider grips target the sternal head of the pecs and anterior delts more, while a closer grip will target the triceps and clavicular (upper chest) more. Using a variety of grip widths in training or experimenting to find what works best for you makes sense.\"),\n",

It's also worth noting that some advanced powerlifters won't always keep joints perfectly stacked to get out wider, but a 2007 study suggests that a maximum width of 1.5 times the acromial distance (roughly 1.5 times shoulder-width) reduces injury risk without seriously compromising maximal strength.\\n\\nRegarding grip, ensure your wrist joints are stacked, meaning from the side view, your wrist should be directly below your knuckles. Avoid excessive hyperextension of the wrist, and correct it by thinking about punching the ceiling as a cue.\"),\n",

For those strictly interested in bodybuilding, the same general setup applies. However, you won't need as extreme of an arch. You may want to take a slightly narrower grip to increase the range of motion. Because your arch is smaller, your feet can be a little further forward, but for shoulder health and stability, keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the lift and maintain some arch in your lumbar spine.\"),\n",

The bar's distance traveled isn't necessarily the same as joint range of motion. For example, compare the joint angles in these two bench press styles: the humerus's position relative to the torso at the end of the range of motion is very similar despite the bar traveling further in a flat back press. Work on building your arch and don't worry too much about limiting your range of motion when using it.\\n\\nNow that we've covered the bench press setup, it's time to execute the set, broken into four phases: unrack, brace, descend, and press.\\n\\n1. **Unrack:** Have your spotter help you lift out, not up. If un-racking by yourself, you may elevate your butt for the lift-off and then drop your hips down once un-racked.

Take a deep breath into your gut, pressing the air out against your belt if you have one.

From the side, the elbows shouldn't be far out in front of the bar; aim to keep the elbows stacked under the bar, and the descending bar path should be down and slightly forward. Touch your chest just below nipple level toward the bottom of your sternum, the highest contact point on your chest. You can optionally pause on your chest for about a second until the bar becomes motionless, required for competitive powerlifting. If purely bodybuilding, simply tap your chest without a pause but ensure controlled touches, not bouncing the weight off your chest.\"),\n",

Think about pressing the bar back toward your face, off your chest, rather than straight up. Think about pushing the floor away with your feet to help initiate leg drive and enforce the back-and-up bar path. Avoid pressing the bar too far back to hit the rack or lose control; bring it back into balance over the shoulder joint, restoring the starting position.'),\n",

To break through, press the bar up and back, not just straight up. Try flaring the elbows more to involve the pecs. Think about lifting the bar with max speed to blast through where deceleration would occur. Generally, stronger pecs and triceps can help. Once accelerating past the sticking point, you can exhale or hold your breath until completely locking out.

Without a bench shirt, it’s less helpful. Many don’t tuck enough, flaring elbows parallel to the bar, which risks injury and creates inefficient bar paths. A slight tuck is good, and as you hit that sticking point, flaring to stack elbows under the bar may help complete the lift. If elbow control is challenging, do slow eccentric presses with lighter weights, mindful of elbow position.\\n\\n2. **Benching with a Flat Back:** You may not need a powerlifter's extreme arch, but maintaining some arch benefits you by safer positioning for lumbar/thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs, a safer shoulder joint due to the decline pushing angle, and generally being stronger, so more load on active muscles.\"),\n",

      "Okay, welcome everyone to a new episode of Technique Tuesday. This week, we're going to be looking at how to perform the squat with perfect technique. The back squat is often referred to as the king of lower body exercises and even the king of all exercises, and that's a title I think it truly deserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we jump into the technique for this exercise, let's take a look at the muscles we're going to be targeting. With the squat, we're training simultaneous hip extension, where the hips straighten out on the way up, and knee extension, where the knees straighten out. The hip extension component will be handled primarily by the glutes with some assistance from the adductor magnus. Even though the hamstrings can perform hip extension, they don't contribute much to the squat due to the bent knee, meaning their muscle length doesn't change much throughout the range of motion. The knee extension component will be mostly handled by the quadriceps. Additionally, we'll be performing an isometric lumbar extension contraction, which will be handled by the spinal erectors of the lower back.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common misconception is that the abs are highly active in the squat, but that's simply not true. EMG data shows low abdominal activity in the squat, which makes sense given that their function is spinal flexion and anti-extension, neither of which occur in the squat. So, we're primarily targeting the glutes, quads, and spinal erectors with the squat. Because the squat involves multiple joints and large muscle masses, it's very conducive to progressive overload and should be trained with relatively heavy weight in a low to moderate rep range. While there are exceptions, doing squats for more than 10 reps can usually cause your cardiovascular system to fatigue before your leg musculature, leading to sloppy form, worse strength gains, and lower muscle activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, I recommend loading the squat with at least seventy percent of your one-rep max or in the five to ten rep range if your goal is primarily hypertrophy and the three to six rep range if your goal is primarily strength. Again, there will be exceptions to this. It's important to be very objective about where your form stands and possibly consider lightening the weight on the bar for a few months while you master the technique. Then, you can build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible will be far better than taking a few months off due to injury from lifting beyond your capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before approaching the bar, do a quick check to ensure you have the right weight on both sides and that the bar is centered in the rack. You want to position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar, you aren't hitting the J-hooks during the walkout. For most, bar positions around armpit height will be a good height. For reasons I've discussed in another video, which I'll link below, I think people actually exaggerate the practical difference between a high bar squat with the bar resting up on your traps and a low bar squat with the bar resting down on your rear delts. Research shows that ultimately, the high bar squat may be a bit more quad dominant and the low bar squat may be a bit more hip dominant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my experience, I think the high bar squat tends to protect the lower back more and tends to feel more comfortable for many people, so we'll be squatting with the high bar position here. The bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward, and it's too low if it feels like it's going to slide down your back. Position your hands as comfortably close to your shoulders as possible, as a closer grip will activate the muscles of the upper back better, leading to a more stable base of support for the bar. Your hands should merely stabilize the bar, keeping it mashed between your palms and your upper back. You shouldn't actively grip the bar like in a bench press; just let it sit and settle on your upper back.\n",
      "\n",
      "With both feet underneath the bar, push your hips forward to unrack the bar. Don't make the mistake of squatting the bar up with your knees, as this will cause unnecessary quad fatigue before the actual lift itself and can contribute to knee pain. Take three steps backward: one small step with your non-dominant leg, one medium step with the other leg, and then a third mini step to get your feet even. Once your feet are set, they should be planted with about a 15 to 30-degree foot flare. In general, you want to make sure that your feet are at least wider than shoulder width.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you've got the squat set up, it's time to actually execute the lift. We're going to split this into three distinct phases: brace, descend, and lift. For the bracing phase, your heel and big toe should be making even pressure on the ground, and your weight should be centered on the middle of your foot. I don't like the cue to keep your weight on your heels since it can throw your balance off and cause your hips to shoot up early. You really want your weight evenly distributed across the entire foot. Your head should be slightly extended with your eyes gazing straight ahead, and your elbows should be pointing slightly back, avoiding positioning them directly under the bar, which can lead to elbow pain. Pull a huge breath of air deep into your diaphragm, pushing your gut out against your belt to create a solid, rigid column down your spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you're fully braced and ready to begin the descent. For the high bar position, break at the hips and the knees simultaneously. Looking at the knees first, push your knees forward and slightly out so that they track in the same direction as your toes, while sitting your hips straight down. Push through your heel, big toe, and pinky toe throughout the eccentric, keeping an even weight distribution through your feet. When viewed from the side, the bar path should be a perfectly straight line, moving straight down centered directly over the middle of the foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower the bar under control, actively driving your upper back into it and not allowing your chest to fall forward. You don't want to descend excessively slowly to the point where you start to lose gas early; generally, aim for about a one-second negative on the squat. Regarding squat depth, I recommend at least squatting parallel to the ground as a minimum standard for hypertrophy and general strength. However, for regulation technique, you technically need to get the hip crease below the knee joint, meaning you must go below parallel. Most people should be able to squat to this depth when using a high bar position with the appropriate stance width for their particular skeleton and mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "This position is what we call being in the hole. Unless you're doing paused squats as a specific training drill, you generally don’t want to pause in the hole. Instead, take advantage of the stretch reflex at the bottom and immediately reverse the motion the second you hit depth. Although you want to maintain an erect, upright posture during the ascent, I'm not a big fan of the \"chest up\" cue myself since it can cause some trainees to lean too far back. I prefer to think about driving your back up into the bar while keeping your head slightly up, which pulls the spine into a good lifting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, with the squat, we aim to move heavy weight and maximize our strength potential, so don’t worry about squeezing any muscles or feeling the burn. You want to explode out of the hole as if you were trying to jump through the ceiling. I personally keep my breath held until about two-thirds of the way up, at which point I exhale. Once I'm back up to the top, I'll begin the bracing phase again, take another deep breath in, and repeat for however many reps my program calls for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are so many errors with the squat, I may have to do another video on mistakes alone. I did a myth-busting video explaining why you should let your knees come forward past the toes and why the cue to keep your knees behind your toes can be harmful to the lower back. I'll link that in the description below. Other than that, one common error is knee valgus or having the knees cave in either on the negative or positive. This usually stems from a lack of proper hip external rotation, so ensure your feet are adequately flared out. Actively drive your knees out in the direction of your toes, but not excessively beyond them. Placing a mini band or hip circle around your knees can help cue for this and strengthen the hip abductors. Wearing a heeled squat shoe can also help. Harrison’s foot pronation, or losing your arch, is a known contributor to knee valgus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two common errors usually come as a two-for-one deal: going too heavy and not going deep enough. Unlike the deadlift, the squat starts with the eccentric phase, making it easier to cheat by loading up the bar with more weight than you can handle and only going halfway down. On the deadlift, if you can’t lift the weight, it just stays on the ground—it’s harder to cheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "You also want to be careful with \"butt wink\" or lower back rounding. If your back is excessively rounding during the squat, you may want to cut your depth a bit shorter or modify your stance width. I think some degree of butt wink is inevitable for many lifters and isn’t concerning, especially if it’s mild and doesn’t cause pain or discomfort. Foam rolling and dynamic stretching before squatting will increase joint range of motion acutely and may help reduce butt wink as you hit depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can’t squat due to injury, which I think is the only reason not to squat, I recommend using a machine, hack squat, or even a Smith machine squat if it's more comfortable. Lunges are great as well but won’t have the same overloading potential. As a last resort, a leg press plus a lower back extension captures a decent amount of what the squat trains.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I have for the squat. Before you guys click out of the video, I want to let you know I just launched a new squat program on my website. It’s a 10-week program featuring some squat variations hit four times per week, with volume tapering down to a new one-rep max test in week 10. If you've been trying to improve your squat, this program will increase your squat max. If you run it for 10 weeks and don’t set a new PR, just send me an email, and I'll issue a full refund for the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm launching this program for just $12.99 for this week, and it will go up to $19.99 after that. To give you some idea, this is week one, day one, with all the squat work and lower body accessory work programmed, plus coaching notes from me. The upper body work is flexible, so you should be able to fit this squat routine into your current regimen. I also give guidance on setting that up with different splits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, you can learn more about that if you're interested on jeffnipper.com. It'll be 35% off until next Tuesday only.

Then, you can build your way back up to your previous loads with good form. A few months of not going as heavy as possible will be far better than taking a few months off due to injury from lifting beyond your capability.\"),\n",

You want to position the bar height so that when you unrack the bar, you aren't hitting the J-hooks during the walkout. For most, bar positions around armpit height will be a good height. For reasons I've discussed in another video, which I'll link below, I think people actually exaggerate the practical difference between a high bar squat with the bar resting up on your traps and a low bar squat with the bar resting down on your rear delts. Research shows that ultimately, the high bar squat may be a bit more quad dominant and the low bar squat may be a bit more hip dominant.\"),\n",

The bar is too high if it's pushing your head forward, and it's too low if it feels like it's going to slide down your back. Position your hands as comfortably close to your shoulders as possible, as a closer grip will activate the muscles of the upper back better, leading to a more stable base of support for the bar. Your hands should merely stabilize the bar, keeping it mashed between your palms and your upper back. You shouldn't actively grip the bar like in a bench press; just let it sit and settle on your upper back.\"),\n",

We're going to split this into three distinct phases: brace, descend, and lift. For the bracing phase, your heel and big toe should be making even pressure on the ground, and your weight should be centered on the middle of your foot. I don't like the cue to keep your weight on your heels since it can throw your balance off and cause your hips to shoot up early. You really want your weight evenly distributed across the entire foot. Your head should be slightly extended with your eyes gazing straight ahead, and your elbows should be pointing slightly back, avoiding positioning them directly under the bar, which can lead to elbow pain.

I did a myth-busting video explaining why you should let your knees come forward past the toes and why the cue to keep your knees behind your toes can be harmful to the lower back. I'll link that in the description below. Other than that, one common error is knee valgus or having the knees cave in either on the negative or positive. This usually stems from a lack of proper hip external rotation, so ensure your feet are adequately flared out. Actively drive your knees out in the direction of your toes, but not excessively beyond them. Placing a mini band or hip circle around your knees can help cue for this and strengthen the hip abductors. Wearing a heeled squat shoe can also help. Harrison’s foot pronation, or losing your arch, is a known contributor to knee valgus.\"),\n",

Unlike the deadlift, the squat starts with the eccentric phase, making it easier to cheat by loading up the bar with more weight than you can handle and only going halfway down. On the deadlift, if you can’t lift the weight, it just stays on the ground—it’s harder to cheat.\\n\\nYou also want to be careful with \"butt wink\" or lower back rounding. If your back is excessively rounding during the squat, you may want to cut your depth a bit shorter or modify your stance width. I think some degree of butt wink is inevitable for many lifters and isn’t concerning, especially if it’s mild and doesn’t cause pain or discomfort. Foam rolling and dynamic stretching before squatting will increase joint range of motion acutely and may help reduce butt wink as you hit depth.'),\n",

      "down on the bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this position, you\n",
      "should be far enough down from the bar, meaning toward the foot end of the\n",
      "bench, so that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the underside of the\n",
      "bar.  Your feet should be flat on the ground with your shins approximately\n",
      "vertical. Your upper back should be flat against the bench with your lower back\n",
      "in an anatomically normal arched position. Take an overhand grip on the bar.\n",
      "Your grip should be somewhere between 22 and 24 inches, measured between the\n",
      "index fingers. This grip width will result in a vertical forearm for most people\n",
      "when the bar is touching the chest at the bottom. The bar should rest on the\n",
      "heel of your palm, not on the fingers, and directly over the bones of the\n",
      "forearm. Just like the press, this grip is best accomplished by pronating your\n",
      "hands with a slight internal rotation of your arms.  You are now ready to take\n",
      "the bar out of the rack. Look directly up at the ceiling and push up on the bar,\n",
      "locking out your elbows. Move the bar out to a position directly over the line\n",
      "of your shoulder joints. This is the place where the bar is in balance at\n",
      "lockout. Note carefully the position of the bar against the ceiling; this\n",
      "picture is your reference for the path the bar will take as you move it down and\n",
      "up. You will lower the bar to your chest, touch the chest, and then drive the\n",
      "bar right back to the exact position you are looking at on the ceiling overhead.\n",
      "Stare at the place on the ceiling where the bar is to go; do not watch the bar\n",
      "as it moves.  With the bar locked out over the shoulders, have your spotter\n",
      "touch your chest a few inches below the bar’s vertical position, at about the\n",
      "middle of your sternum. This tactile cue will quite effectively identify the\n",
      "point on your chest to touch the bar. If there is no spotter and you're benching\n",
      "alone inside a rack, unlock your elbows and then allow them to drop towards your\n",
      "feet a little on the way down. If you do this correctly, the net effect will be\n",
      "the same as the spotter's touch. The bar will contact your sternum a few inches\n",
      "below your clavicles and, therefore, below your shoulder joints.  Look at the\n",
      "ceiling, unlock your elbows, lower the bar to your chest, touch without\n",
      "stopping, and then drive the bar back to the point on the ceiling your eyes have\n",
      "targeted. Try it for a set of five reps. You'll immediately notice that if your\n",
      "eyes don't move from their fixed position, the bar will go to the same place\n",
      "every rep. Do another set of five with the bar, reinforcing your eye position,\n",
      "and then rack the bar. This is done with locked elbows after the last rep is\n",
      "finished. Should you have a spotter, this movement back to the rack should be\n",
      "covered.  Now that we've covered the basic movement pattern for the bench press,\n",
      "we can maximize the efficiency of the lift by improving the position of the\n",
      "upper back, legs, and feet. The upper back needs to be planted firmly against\n",
      "the bench and used as a platform to drive against while the arms drive the bar\n",
      "up. When this is done correctly, the shoulder blades will be adducted, or\n",
      "pinched together. Sit on the bench in the same position you assumed before lying\n",
      "down to take the bar. Imagine a hand touching you right between the shoulder\n",
      "blades and imagine pinching the hand between your shoulder blades. This pinching\n",
      "will also cause you to raise your chest, further contributing to a good\n",
      "position. Now lie down, take the bar out, and assume this same position, making\n",
      "sure your shoulder blades are pinched together and your chest is up high. Your\n",
      "goal is to be able to do all your reps without losing this set position against\n",
      "the bench.  Used correctly, the legs drive against the floor during the bench\n",
      "press, transferring force horizontally along the bench, through the hips, into\n",
      "the arched back to reinforce the arch and keep the chest in its high position.\n",
      "Remember that you cannot raise your butt up off of the bench at any time. Your\n",
      "foot position should be set so that your shins are nearly vertical. This\n",
      "position allows for the efficient use of your legs in reinforcing the arch but\n",
      "doesn't predispose you to bridge your butt up off of the bench. The proper\n",
      "position for the feet is flat against the floor so that the heels can be used as\n",
      "the base of the drive up the legs. If you're up on your toes, you cannot use the\n",
      "force of knee extension nearly as efficiently as you can if your heels are\n",
      "planted.  For the next sets of five reps, add a little weight until the bar\n",
      "speed begins to slow down and your form starts to change. Stay at that weight\n",
