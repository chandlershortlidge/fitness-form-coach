The purpose of this study was to increase the body \\nof knowledge concerning the biomechanics of the bench press as performed by novice \\nlifters.  Muscular activity and the kinematics of the lifter, as well as the kinematics and \\nkinetics of the bar, were assessed during different variations of the exercise.   \\n \\nWhile most training regimens incorporate multiple repetition sets, there is little data \\ndescribing how the kinematics of a lift change during a set to failure.  The purpose of the \\nfirst study was to examine these changes in novice lifters.  Subjects were recruited and \\nasked to perform a maximal single lift (1-RM) and then as many repetitions as possible at \\n75% of the 1-RM load; three-dimensional kinematic data were recorded and analyzed for \\nall lifts.  Statistical analysis revealed differences between the maximal and submaximal \\nlifts, and also that the kinematics of a submaximal lift change as a subject approaches \\nfailure in a set.  Within the set, the time to lift the bar more than doubled from the first to \\nthe last repetition, causing a decrease in both mean and peak upward velocity.  \\nFurthermore, the peak upward velocity occurred much earlier in the lift phase in these \\nlater repetitions.  The path the bar followed also changed, with subjects keeping the bar \\nmore directly over the shoulder during the lift.  In general, most of the kinematic \\nvariables analyzed became more similar to those of the maximal lift as the subjects \\nprogressed through a set, but there was considerable variation between subjects as to \\nwhich repetition was most like the maximal lift.   \\n \\nThe purpose of the second study was to determine the vertical and lateral forces applied \\nalong the bar during a maximal and a submaximal effort bench press lift.  Novice lifters \\nwere asked to perform a maximal and submaximal (80% of maximal lift) bench press.  \\nThese lifts were performed using a bar instrumented to record forces applied to it in the \\nvertical direction as well as along the long axis of the bar (lateral force).  Statistical \\nanalysis revealed the average lateral force was between 22 and 29% of the applied \\n \\n \\niv\\nvertical force.  The profile of the lateral force tended to be similar to the profile of the \\nvertical force in both lifts.  The absolute vertical and lateral forces were greater for the \\nmaximal lift than for the submaximal lift, but these forces were not different when \\ncompared as a percentage of the load lifted.  Thus, it is clear that a substantial portion of \\nthe force generated by the lifter is applied along the long axis of the bar.   \\n \\nThe purpose of the third study was to determine how electromyographic (EMG) activity, \\nlift kinematics, and vertical and lateral forces applied to the bar were affected when \\nperforming the bench press at different grip widths.  Again, novice lifters were recruited \\nand asked to perform a maximal bench press at self-selected grip width, and then five \\nsubmaximal (75% of maximal lift) lifts at predetermined grip widths.  EMG data were \\nrecorded for the pectoralis, the triceps, the biceps, and the anterior deltoid.  Statistical \\nanalysis revealed that peak vertical and lateral forces decreased as grip width increased, \\nwith the magnitude of the lateral forces remaining about one quarter of the vertical \\nforces.  Higher peak forces and EMG recordings were observed in the descent rather than \\nthe lift phase; neither peak nor mean EMG levels were systematically affected by grip \\nwidth.  Given that the same load was lifted with smaller vertical and lateral forces,  it \\nappears that a wider grip appears to be a more efficient position for performing the bench \\npress.   \\n \\nThe general findings of this research project show that novice lifters displayed different \\nkinematic and muscle activation patterns than those reported in experienced recreational \\nand competitive lifters.  These novice lifters moved the bar differently when performing \\nsets of repetitions for training than they do when performing maximal lifts.  They \\ndisplayed very little change in muscle activation pattern when lifting maximal versus \\nsubmaximal loads.  Kinetic analysis revealed that a substantial portion of the force \\ngenerated by novice lifters is applied outward along the bar.  The magnitude of this \\nlateral force was about one quarter that of the vertical force.  Lifting with narrower grip \\nwidths resulted in greater vertical and lateral forces, but contrary to published literature, \\ndid not alter muscle activation levels.   \\n \\n \\n \\nv\\nTABLE OF

Their help has \\ncome in many forms: some have offered advice based on their experiences, some have \\noffered intellectual aid, and some have provided me with a temporary and much needed \\nescape from the process.  While I can not thank everyone who has helped me along this \\njourney, there are a few that I do need to offer special thanks.  \\n \\nI would first like to thank the members for my committee, Drs. Buckley, Frievalds, and \\nGottschall for their time, help, thoughts, critiques, and eventually for their approval. \\n \\nI would like to thank my master’s advisor and now friend, Dr. Messier.  While working \\nwith him, I first discovered the world of biomechanics and began to think about \\ncontinuing on in graduate school.  Throughout the years of Ph.D work, I continuously \\nheard his words (and Rhode Island accent) in my head telling me it was not a test of how \\nsmart I was, but if could stick with it and finish.  Those words have truly come to \\ndescribe my Ph.D experience. \\n \\nI would like to thank my parents, my sister, and her family.  They have provided me with \\nunquestioning support, perhaps more than I deserved, throughout the process.  They have \\nalso graciously put up with me being much less available for them than I would have \\nliked.  I also need to thank my two nephews who were both born during this process.  \\nThey neither knew nor cared what a dissertation was, and loved me just the same.    \\n \\nI need to thank my advisor, Dr. John Challis.  Without his advice, support, time, and \\npatience, I would never have continued on to finish.  Unfortunately, I can not express \\nhow much I appreciate his help nor will I ever be able to repay him for all of the time and \\neffort that he has donated to me.  He has been a truly outstanding advisor. \\n \\n \\n \\nxii\\nFinally, I need to thank my wife, Michele.  She has steadily (and usually quietly) \\nsupported me throughout the long, slow years that have been my doctoral experience.  \\nShe has helped the most and also sacrificed the most.

Its history spans at least 3,000 years, \\nwith evidence of exercises being performed in the ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese \\nsocieties.  Often, early depictions, for example on vases, include soldiers lifting stones or \\nbags of sand as physical preparation for the rigors of battle.  According to Greek legend, \\nthe undefeated wrestler Milo carried a calf every day as part of a conditioning program.  \\nAs the calf grew, Milo grew stronger, making this perhaps the earliest example of a \\nprogressive resistance training program.  Training programs and equipment have \\ncertainly evolved over time, as exemplified by machines designed for weight training \\ndating back to the early 1600s.  \\n \\nCompetitions in weight lifting have been held formally for well over 100 years, with the \\nfirst world championship competition held in England in 1891, and have been included in \\nalmost every modern Olympics.  The weight lifting competition in the 1896 Olympics \\nconsisted of the one-handed lift and the two-handed lift.  The two-handed lift, similar to a \\nclean and jerk, was won by Viggo Jensen of Denmark.  His lift of 110kg was the same as \\nthat of the second place finisher, Launceston Elliott of Great Britain, but Jensen was \\nawarded the victory when his lift was declared to have been a cleaner lift.  The one-\\nhanded lift was a snatch-type event and followed immediately.  In this event, Elliott’s lift \\nof 71kg far outpaced Jensen’s second place effort of 57kg.  Apparently Jensen had \\ninjured his shoulder during the two-handed competition.  Weight lifting events were \\nincluded again in the 1904 games and, following a temporary suspension, have been \\nincluded in every Summer Olympics since 1920, though the events have changed.   \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\nCurrent weight lifting competitions are separated into two categories.  “Weightlifting” \\ncompetitions, including those performed in the Summer Olympics, consist of the snatch \\nand the clean and jerk.  “Powerlifting” competitions involve three exercises: the squat, \\nthe dead lift and the bench press.  Because of their powerful influence on total muscular \\nstrength, competitions in both Powerlifting and Weightlifting are conducted in categories \\nbased on both sex and body mass.   \\n \\nAs a result of its inclusion in Powerlifting, as well as its overwhelming popularity in \\ngeneral weight training, the bench press is probably the most popular weight training \\nexercise.  Perusal of almost any introductory or higher level text on weight training will \\ninclude the bench press.  It is a multi-joint, upper body exercise that involves muscles of \\nthe torso, the shoulders and the upper extremity.   \\n \\n1.2 Definition of Movement in the Bench Press \\nThe bench press is a simple, classic exercise.  It is typically performed with the lifter in a \\nsupine position on a flat bench.  A straight bar is held with the arms extended upward and \\nthe palms turned toward the lifter’s feet.  Typical grip width is shoulder width or slightly \\nwider apart, although different grip widths may be used to alter the muscles emphasized.  \\nThe bar is lowered to the chest and then lifted back up until the arms are fully extended \\nonce again.  For the purposes of this research, the bench press is divided into two phases, \\nthe descent phase and the lift phase, which are defined as follows:   \\nThe descent phase:  Starting with both arms extended upward, the time \\nfrom the onset of downward movement to the point at which the bar \\ntouches the chest and reaches zero vertical velocity. \\nThe lift phase: The time from the beginning of upward movement of the \\nbar from the chest until the bar reaches its highest point and vertical \\nvelocity returns to zero.  \\nA more thorough description of the movement and these time point definitions \\nappears in Chapter 3.  \\n \\n \\n1.3  Purpose of the Study \\n \\n \\n3\\nThe purpose of this study was to increase the body of knowledge concerning the \\nbiomechanics of the bench press.  Muscular activity, as well as the kinematics and \\nkinetics of the bar, were assessed during different variations of the exercise. \\n \\n1.3.1 Specific Aims of the Study \\nThere were three specific aims of the study.   \\n \\nAim 1 was to compare the kinematics of the bar of a single, maximal effort lift with those \\nof a multiple repetition set performed at 75% of the maximum load.  The vast majority of \\nthe data available on single, maximal lift mechanics was collected on highly competitive \\npower lifters.  There is little data on non-elite and recreational lifters, which by definition, \\nmake up the majority of the population of people who weight train.  Since most weight \\ntraining programs involve multiple repetition sets, it is important to know the differences \\nin mechanics that may exist between single and multiple repetition efforts. \\n \\nAim 2 was to examine the forces exerted by the lifter on the bar, specifically vertical and \\nalong the bar, in the bench press.   The vertical forces applied by the lifter have been \\nreported, but there is no report of any horizontal forces.  Understanding the magnitude \\nand direction of the forces applied may shed light on methods for better performance of \\nthe exercise.  It may prove that a different force pattern would be beneficial when \\nperforming a maximal and a submaximal lift.  To achieve this aim, an instrumented bar \\nwas designed to record vertical and horizontal forces applied to the bar during a flat \\nbench press.   \\n \\nAim 3 was to examine the effects of varying the grip width in the bench press.  More \\nspecifically, the goal was to determine the how an increase in grip width alters the \\nrelative muscular activity and the forces, both vertical and along the bar, during the bench \\npress.  \\n \\n \\n \\n1.4  Overview of the Study \\n \\n \\n4\\nTo achieve the general purpose of this study, kinetic, kinematic, and electromyography \\n(EMG) data were collected on a group of subjects performing different variations of the \\nbench press.  Those variations included: a single lift with maximal load; a single lift at \\nvarious grip widths; and multiple repetitions performed in a set to failure.  These different \\ntasks were chosen based on the specific aims of the study.  \\n \\n1.5 Dissertation Structure \\nFollowing this introduction, this document will be divided into five chapters.   \\n \\n1.5.1  Chapter 2: Review of Literature \\nThis chapter contains a review of the literature as it pertains to the biomechanical analysis \\nof the bench press.  Primary topics of interest and discussion include: 1) Patterns of the \\nbar kinematics in both maximal and submaximal effort, as well as patterns observed in \\nhighly skilled and less skilled lifters; 2) Vertical forces applied to the bar; and 3) \\nMuscular activation in the bench press.  Additional attention is paid to modification of \\nthe lift, including varying grip widths and how these changes affect relative activity of \\nthe muscles involved during the lift, as well as lifting performance.  Finally, the \\napplication of the research techniques involved in this study will be discussed in other \\nresistance training applications, including the squat.  \\n \\n1.5.2  Chapter 3: Fatigue effects on bar kinematics during the bench press \\nThe goal of this study was to examine the differences in the kinematics of the bar when \\nperforming a single, maximal lift and when performing set to failure at 75% of maximal \\nlift load.  Little change was seen in the descent phase of each repetition, so specific \\nattention was paid to a) the velocity of the bar, and b) the path the bar followed during the \\nlift phase.  Clear differences were seen in both velocity and path when comparing the \\nlifts.  The first and last repetitions were significantly different from each other in a set to \\nfailure.  Furthermore, as a subject progressed through the set to failure, the lifting pattern \\ntended to become more similar to the maximal lift, but still maintaining observable \\ndifferences.  The impact of this on training program development is discussed.  This \\nchapter consists of an article that has been published in the Journal of Strength and \\nConditioning Research.   \\n \\n \\n5\\n \\n1.5.3  Chapter 4: Forces applied to the bar during the bench press \\nThis purpose of this study was to determine the vertical and lateral forces applied to the \\nbar during the bench press. Three dimensional kinematic analysis of the bar was \\ncombined with a unique, instrumented bar designed for this study that made assessment \\nof vertical and lateral kinetics possible.  Lateral forces are indeed applied to the bar, and \\nthey average approximately one quarter the magnitude of the vertical forces.  The vertical \\nforce profile of the novice subjects in this study was similar to descriptions of the vertical \\nforce profile of more experienced lifters.  This chapter consists of an article that has been \\naccepted for publication in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.   \\n   \\n \\n1.5.4  Chapter 5: Kinetic and electromyographic changes when grip width is varied \\nin the bench press \\nThe purpose of this study was to determine changes in muscle activation patterns, \\nestimated via electromyography (EMG) and the vertical and lateral forces applied to the \\nbar during a single repetition bench press performed at several different grip widths.  \\nThree dimensional kinematic data were again combined with data collected using the \\ninstrumented bar as well as superficial EMG data.  Statistical analysis revealed that \\nmuscle activity patterns are different between the descent and lift phases but few changes \\nare seen between the maximal and submaximal lifts, or across grip width positions.  \\nForces applied to the bar, both vertically and laterally, tended to decrease as grip width \\nincreased. \\n \\n1.5.5  Chapter 6:  Summary and Conclusions \\nThis chapter summarizes the main work and findings from the three studies.  It discusses \\nthe limitations of this work and makes recommendations for further work. \\n \\n \\n6\\nCHAPTER 2 \\n \\nReview of literature \\n \\n2.1  Introduction \\nThe following subsections will discuss the body of literature that covers the topic of \\nbiomechanics as it relates to the bench press.  Specific topics to be covered include: \\nkinematics and kinetics of both the lifter and the bar during the bench press; \\nelectromyography (EMG), especially its use in assessing force output and muscle fatigue \\nduring weight lifting tasks; a description of the literature on other weight training tasks \\nthat may provide insight on studying the bench press; and finally, some of the training \\naspects that affect lifting performance. \\n \\n2.2  Kinematics of the Bench Press \\nThe following sections will outline the available literature describing the kinematics of \\nthe both the bar and the lifter during the bench press. \\n \\n2.2.1  Arm Kinematics  \\nThe kinematics of the upper extremity during the bench press, while relatively simple, \\nhave not been closely examined.  The relationship between grip width and bench press \\nperformance has been examined and will be discussed later in this chapter.  Madsen and \\nMcLaughlin (1984) and others have discussed changes in bar path, but have not \\nmentioned corresponding changes in lifter kinematics.  The only direct discussion of \\nupper extremity orientation found in the literature is in McLaughlin’s article in Power-\\nResearch (1985).  In this coaching and performance oriented but non-peer reviewed \\njournal, he briefly discusses the position of the elbow relative to the trunk (“elbows in” \\nversus “elbows out”), but does not offer any definite conclusions.  This lack of data is \\nlikely the result of the two dimensional analyses performed in most of the literature on \\nbench press.  For accurate kinematic data on the upper extremity to be produced, data \\nwould have to be collected in three dimensions.   \\n \\n \\n7\\n \\n2.2.2   Bar Path \\nCompetitive lifting rules and general safety guidelines state that the bar should be kept \\nhorizontal at all times during the bench press.  As a result, the path of the long axis of the \\nbar has typically been described as a para-sagittal plane movement.  Madsen and \\nMcLaughlin (1984) describe typical sagittal plane bar paths for both recreational and \\ncompetitive lifters.  For both groups, the path during the descent phase is nearly linear \\nwith a slight inferior deviation as the bar travels from the top to the bottom of the lift.  \\nDuring the lift phase, recreational lifters display a bar path that remains inferior (caudal) \\nto the downward path while competitive and elite lifters move the bar closer to the head.  \\nIn fact, elite lifters display a noticeable, early superior excursion of the bar as compared \\nwith the competitive lifters.  The authors theorize that this pattern leads to greater lifting \\nsuccess by decreasing the moment created by the bar weight about the shoulder joint \\nduring the lift phase.     \\n \\nThe skilled lifter group also started and finished the exercise with the bar at a lower \\nheight than the unskilled lifters.  The authors analyzed high-speed video of the skilled \\nlifters performing during national and world competitions and did not have direct access \\nto the skilled lifters, therefore, they were not able to measure upper limb length.  They \\nwere able to estimate upper body length from the video however, and found no \\nsignificant difference between the skilled and novice groups.  With this evidence, the \\nauthors suggested that the difference in bar height at the start of the lift was likely due to \\na wider grip rather than shorter arms for the skilled lifters (Madsen and McLaughlin, \\n1984). \\n \\n2.2.3   Bar Velocity and Acceleration \\nOf all of the mechanical aspects of the exercise, the vertical kinematic profile of the bar \\nduring the bench press has received the most attention in the literature.  Several articles \\nhave addressed the topic (e.g. Lander, Bates, Sawhill, and Hammill, 1985; Elliott, \\nWilson, and Kerr, 1989; Wilson, Elliott, and Wood, 1991) with Madsen and McLaughlin \\n(1984) giving the most thorough description.  They described six points on a time plot of \\n \\n \\n8\\nbar velocity (Figure 2.1).  In order, they are:  Start (initiation of downward movement) \\n(Point 1 in Figure 2.1), Maximum Downward Velocity (Point 2), Chest (when the bar is \\nin contact with the chest) (Point 4), Maximum Upward Velocity (Point 6), First Local \\nMinimum Upward Velocity (minimum upward velocity between the two peaks) (Point 8) \\nand End (Point 9).  The authors describe three points in the acceleration profile, all during \\nthe lift phase.  They are: First Local Maximum Upward Aceleration (Point 3), Maximum \\nUpward Acceleration (Point 5), and First Local Minimum Acceleration (Point 7).   \\n \\n-1\\n-0.8\\n-0.6\\n-0.4\\n-0.2\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\n1.5\\n2\\n2.5\\n3\\n3.5\\n4\\n4.5\\n5\\nTime (s)\\nVelocity (m/s) or Acceleration (m/s/s)\\n               Velocity\\n               Acceleration\\n1\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n9\\n8\\n7\\n \\nFigure 2.1:  Typical vertical bar velocity and acceleration during the bench press. The \\nnine point markers coincide with those described by Madsen and McLaughlin (1984) and \\ndiscussed in the text.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9\\n2.2.4  Kinematic Variations With Lifting Skill \\nBefore discussing the kinematic differences between the groups examined, it should be \\nmentioned that there were significant differences in the amount of weight lifted by the \\ntwo groups in Madsen and McLaughlin’s 1984 study.  The expert group lifted an average \\nof 185 kg or 2.3 time body weight (BW), while the novice group lifted 101 kg or 1.3 BW, \\nwhile the mean body masses of the two groups were similar (79 and 77 kg, respectively).  \\nThey found differences in bar velocity and acceleration for recreational versus highly \\nskilled lifters.  Whether looking at downward velocity (0.17 m.s-1 vs. 0.32 m.s-1) or \\nacceleration (3.3 m.s-2 vs. 0.7 m.s-2); the skilled lifters lowered the bar more slowly than \\nthe novice lifters.  In fact, while the expert subjects lowered the bar at about half the \\nvelocity of the novice lifters, they took more time to lower the bar (1.723 s vs. 1.158 s) \\neven though they were lowering it a shorter distance (0.30 m vs. 0.37 m).  The authors \\nsuggest that lowering the bar more slowly reduces the acceleration required to stop the \\ndescent of the bar, therefore reducing the magnitude of the force applied during the \\ndescent phase.  While they do not say this directly, it is assumed that the authors mean \\nthat the peak force required to stop the decent of the bar was lower relative to each \\nindividual lifter’s force curve, not as an absolute lower force.  This is unlikely since the \\nnovice lifters were moving much smaller weights and therefore likely exerted smaller \\nforces throughout the lift.   \\n \\n2.3  Forces Applied to the Bar During the Bench Press  \\nThere is no description in the literature of the magnitude or direction of the resultant \\nforce applied to the bar during the bench press in the literature.  The vertical forces \\napplied to the bar have not been measured with force or strain transducers, but have been \\nestimated from kinematic data. \\n \\n2.3.1  Vertical Force Profile \\nThe earliest detailed description of the vertical forces applied to the bar during the bench \\npress appears to be 1985 (Lander, Bates, Sawhill and Hamill, 1985).  The authors used \\n“skilled lifters” who had a maximal single lift (1RM) of between 1333 and 1822 N (a \\nrelatively broad range of 1.27-2.16 BW).  Only forces during the lift portion of the \\nexercise were described.  The typical vertical force pattern, for a lift at 90% 1RM \\n \\n \\n10\\nincludes four phases.  The first phase, the acceleration phase, involves an early peak \\noccurring at about 5% total lift time (LT) and lasts to about 16% LT.  This phase is \\nfollowed by a period where the force applied is less than the weight of the bar.  This \\nphase lasts from 16 to 42% LT and is termed the “sticking region.”  This phase \\ncorresponds well with the popular “sticking point” in the bench press where most failed \\nlifts occur (Lander et al., 1985;  Madsen and Mclaughlin, 1984).  During the third phase \\nof the lift, from 42 to 82% LT, the force applied to the bar is once again greater than the \\nweight of the bar and is termed the maximum strength region.  The rationale for the name \\nof this phase is not provided.  The final phase, occurring during the last 18% LT is the \\ndeceleration phase and once again, the force applied to the bar drops below the weight of \\nthe bar.   \\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n1.2\\n1.4\\nTime (s)\\nForce (N)\\nA\\nS\\nM\\nD\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMadsen and McLaughlin (1984) studied a group of 19 national and world class \\ncompetitive lifters and a group of 17 recreational lifters and determined that there are \\nseveral differences in the force applied to the bar when lifting skill increases.  The \\nauthors state that expert lifters exert greater peak forces during both the lower and the lift, \\neven when normalized to body weight.  These finding are not surprising given that the \\nlifts of the expert group were ranked in the top three in the world.   \\n \\nFigure 2.2:  Typical vertical force curve during the bench press.  A: Acceleration \\nPhase, S: Sticking Region, M: Maximal Force Region, D: Deceleration Phase. From \\nLander, Bates, Sawhill and Hamill, 1985. \\n \\n \\n11\\n \\n2.3.2  Grip Width and Resultant Force  \\nThere is no description in the literature of how varying grip width affects the magnitude \\nor direction of the resultant force applied to the bar, however, pilot testing with subjects \\nperforming push ups at various hand widths indicated a positive correlation between hand \\nwidth (effectively grip width) and horizontal force (Duffey and Zatsiorsky, 2003).  \\nTherefore, it would be expected that as grip width in the bench press increases, the \\nresultant force would be applied in a more outward (lateral) direction.   \\n \\n2.4  Isokinetic and Isotonic Bench Press  \\nStudies of the kinetics of the bench press have especially focused on differences in free-\\nweight and isokinetic lifting.  Fundamental differences exist between isokinetic exercise \\nand free-weight exercise.  First, the load at the beginning and end of the range of motion \\nof an exercise is typically zero for isokinetic exercise, while it remains effectively \\nconstant when using weights.  This is because isokinetic machines typically are designed \\nto reduce the load or resistance when the speed of the exercise drops below the desired or \\nset speed.  Another difference involves the possible direction of movement between the \\ndifferent categories of exercise.  Free weights, by definition, are allowed to translate in all \\nthree directions whereas isokinetic machines typically allow movement only through a \\nprescribed path, usually an arc.  Studies can be designed to reduce the differences \\nbetween the two types of exercise.   \\n \\nLander et al. (1985) compared the vertical forces during free-weight and isokinetic bench \\npress lifts.  A “Cybex Power Bench Press” was used for the isokinetic trials.  This device \\nincorporated a transducer to record torque applied by the lifter which were later \\nconverted to vertical forces.  They first examined subjects using free-weights, lifting \\nloads equivalent to 90% and 75% of the maximal weight lifted in a single repetition \\n(1RM).  In these trials, subjects were asked to lift producing the greatest possible power \\nwithout bouncing the bar on the chest.  Since the load was constant, it is assumed that the \\nlifters were instructed to lift as quickly as possible.  The mean velocity for each lifter was \\ndetermined for the two conditions, and these velocities were then employed for the two \\nisokinetic conditions.     \\n \\n \\n12\\n \\nIn general, the force patterns exhibited in both sets of trials (75% and 90% load or speed) \\nin both conditions (free-weight and isokinetic) were similar, but not identical.  Not \\nsurprisingly, the forces exerted during the 90% 1RM trials were greater, and were exerted \\nfor a longer period of time, than during the 75% trials.  The time to the first maximum \\nforce was slower for the isokinetic trials at 90% 1RM.  The design of the isokinetic \\nsystem is the likely explanation for this.  The force applied at the bottom of the lift (the \\nbar on the chest) is zero when using the isokinetic system while in the free-weight \\ncondition, the force applied to the bar should be nearly the weight of the bar \\n(approximately 1600N for the 90% condition).  Therefore, more time will be required for \\nthe muscles to create the same maximal force.   \\n \\nRosentswieg, Hinson and Ridgway (1975) examined muscle activity at the different \\nspeeds during an isokinetic bench press task.  They employed “The Super Mini Gym, \\nModel #130”, which could be set at “Slow, Moderate and Fast” speeds, which were \\ndetermined by the manufacturer and are apparently not quantified in the study.  Their \\nfindings indicate increasing electrical activity in the involved muscles as speed of \\nexercise decreased, which will be discussed further in the next section.  No direct \\ncomparisons were made to free weight exercise.   \\n \\n2.5  Electromyography \\nIn the following sub-sections, EMG concepts will be reviewed as they pertain to weight \\ntraining exercise.   \\n \\n2.5.1  Definition and Practice \\nElectromyography is the study of the electrical activity in muscle.  In humans, it is \\ntraditionally performed either by inserting a wire into the muscle (fine wire or indwelling \\nEMG) or by placing electrodes on the skin superficial to the muscle (superficial or \\nsurface EMG).  The electrodes or wires detect electric current, caused by motor unit \\naction potentials, as it passes through the muscle.  The electrical signal, through an \\nelectro-chemical pathway, initiates the contraction of the muscle.  While it is possible to \\nexamine the electrical activity of a single motor unit when using indwelling electrodes, \\n \\n \\n13\\nsurface EMG will record the activity of multiple motor units.  Thus the recording seen in \\nsurface EMG represents a sample of the summation of the nearby motor unit action \\npotentials (MUAP). \\n \\nIn general, as the frequency of MUAPs increases and more motor units are recruited, the \\nmagnitude of the signal recorded will increase.  Frequently, to analyze the magnitude of \\nthe signal, the raw EMG signal is full wave rectified, and then a low pass filter is \\nemployed to create a linear envelope.  The area enclosed by this envelope can then be \\ndetermined and used as a measure of EMG amplitude.  Other options for assessment \\ninclude taking a mean or a peak value over a period of time.  Along with the amplitude, \\nfrequency content of the signal is often examined and used as an assessment of muscle \\ncontraction, particularly fatigue in muscles as well as the type of muscle fiber \\ncontracting. The rationale and the physiologic representation of both of these measures \\nwill be discussed in later sections.   \\n \\n2.5.2  Normalization  \\nThere are many factors that can alter the relationship between the EMG signal and the \\nforce production of a muscle.  Some of these factors include: type of EMG electrode \\n(surface versus indwelling), size of the muscle, distance from the electrodes to the muscle \\nfibers, amount of tissue (especially fat) between electrodes and the muscle fibers, contact \\nbetween the skin and the electrode, and position and orientation of the electrode on or in \\nthe muscle (De Luca, 1997).  These factors further reinforce that, especially when \\nperforming in vivo, normalization of the EMG signal is imperative for deriving a result \\nthat has any physiological relevance.   \\n \\nThere are options available for the method of normalization.  Typically, however, the \\nstrength of the signal during the measured activity is normalized to, or divided by, a \\nmaximal signal that was recorded.  This maximal value can be taken during the activity, \\nor it may have been recorded during a separate activity, like a maximal isometric \\ncontraction. \\n \\n \\n \\n14\\nYang and Winter (1984) performed a study focusing on normalization methods as a way \\nof improving the information gathered about muscle activity during gait.  Their \\nevaluation criterion was the reduction of variability.  They found that normalization using \\na 50% isometric contraction was inferior to other available normalization methods and in \\nfact, worse than non-normalized data.  Normalization using either the peak or the mean of \\nthe “ensemble average” proved to be the best methods for reducing variability.   \\nAveraging the data presented for the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the biceps \\nfemoris and the soleus, the coefficient of variability was 2.7 and 2.9 times greater when \\nnormailizing to 50% MVC versus normalizing to the peak and the average ensemble \\ntaken during walking, respectively.  What is meant by “ensemble” is not clearly defined, \\nhowever these two calculations appear to equate to the peak and the mean EMG level \\nvalue for a given subject within a stride, which seems to make them similar to a dynamic \\nmaximum or a dynamic average taken within a single movement cycle.        \\n \\nBurden and Bartlett (1999) compared four methods of normalizing an EMG signal from \\nthe biceps of five subjects during an elbow flexion task.  The four methods were \\nnormalization with respect to  (1) peak and (2) mean EMG value during dynamic \\ncontraction (Dynamic Peak Method and Dynamic Mean Method, respectively), (3) EMG \\nvalue during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and, (4) EMG value \\nduring an maximal voluntary isokinetic contraction performed at a similar isokinetic \\nspeed and angular position as the activity of interest.  The mean EMG value was obtained \\nfor each subject during each phase (concentric and eccentric).  As there is no “gold \\nstandard” for comparison, the authors used a root mean square difference method for \\nevaluation of the difference between each of the first three methods and the fourth \\nnormalization method.  Their results indicated that either isometric or isokinetic MVC \\ndata should be used for normalization. \\n \\n2.5.3  Electromyography-Force Relationship in Muscle   \\nThe ability to use EMG as a method of assessing muscle force is a topic of much debate \\nin the literature.  It seems clear that there is some relationship; in general, as the intensity \\nof the motor neuron signal to a muscle increases, the electrical activity in the muscle \\nincreases, and the force produced increases as well (Lippold, 1952).  Because it is much \\n \\n \\n15\\neasier, at least in living humans, to asses the electrical activity of a muscle than it is to \\nmeasure the force output of a muscle, the EMG-recorded signal has been used to estimate \\nforce output of the muscle.  Laboratory experiments have done this with reasonable \\nsuccess.  In vivo, the relationship is less strong, and holds up better with isometric \\ncontractions than dynamic ones.   Early research seemed to indicate a nearly linear \\nrelationship between force and EMG signal (Lippold, 1952; Bigland and Lippold, 1954) \\nespecially in isometric conditions, while later publications provide evidence for a more \\ncurvilinear relationship (Clamann and Broecker, 1979; Komi and Buskirk, 1972) \\nespecially in dynamic conditions.  Bigland-Ritchie suggests that the relationship may be \\neither, and partially depends on the muscle being investigated (Bigland-Ritchie, Kukulka \\nand Woods, 1980) and may actually be a result of the fiber type within the muscle. \\n \\nTo further complicate the matter, many factors affect the maximal force output of a \\nmuscle in vivo, including: cross sectional area of the muscle, the ratio of fiber types, \\nmuscle velocity, and muscle length, among others.  Furthermore, many factors can affect \\nthe EMG signal recorded on a given muscle, including: electrode attachment and \\nimpedance, size of muscle, distance from muscle to the electrode, fatty tissue, muscle \\nvelocity, and electrode movement (De Luca, 1997).  Finally, in vivo it is very difficult to \\nmeasure the force output of a single muscle.  More often a torque produced by a group of \\nmuscles working together, as well as the contribution of antagonist muscles, is recorded.   \\n \\nThere are so many factors that can alter the absolute force output of a muscle and also the \\nsignal recorded, that estimation of absolute muscle force from EMG signal can be \\nproblematic.  As a result, the relative level of contraction of a muscle rather than its \\nabsolute force output is more often assessed.   \\n \\n2.5.4  Fatigue Relationship \\nThe first description of the relationship between EMG signal and muscle fatigue was in \\n1912.  Specifically, Piper described that muscle fatigue can be observed in surface EMG \\nsignal as a reduction in EMG signal frequency (Piper, 1912).  In addition, Cobb and \\nForbes (1923) found that muscular fatigue was indicated by an increase in the amplitude \\nof surface EMG signal without a concurrent increase in force.   Since that time, research \\n \\n \\n16\\non the topic has progressed to establish two general relationships between EMG signal \\nand fatigue: as fatigue occurs, force output decreases but EMG amplitude remains the \\nsame or increases, and there is a shift in the EMG signal toward a lower mean and \\nmedian frequency (De Luca, 1997).  The underlying physiologic reason for this shift is \\nthat fatigue creates a change in the muscle fiber membrane permeability, thereby \\ndecreasing the conduction velocity of the fiber (Kamen and Caldwell, 1996).  Commonly, \\nin sustained submaximal activity, there will also be an increase in the amplitude of the \\nsignal without an increase in force production.  This is likely caused by an increase in the \\nnumber of recruited muscle fibers (Kamen and Caldwell, 1996) or an increase in the time \\nduration of the MUAP, which at least in part is due to a decrease in conduction velocity \\nof the action potential, which may be the result of a pH change in the muscle (De Luca, \\n1997). \\n \\n2.6  Electromyography and Bench Press \\nIn the following subsections, the literature that addresses EMG analysis and muscular \\nactivity during the bench press will be discussed.  \\n \\n2.6.1  Electromyography and Isokinetic Bench Press \\nThe earliest article in the literature describing EMG activity during the bench press, and \\nthe only one that explored EMG during and isokinetic bench press, is the 1975 Research \\nQuarterly article by Rosentswieg, Hinson and Ridgway.  The authors studied 11 college \\nage women performing the bench press on an isokinetic device called the Super Mini \\nGym, Model #130.  The purpose of the study was to determine how the speed of the \\nbench press influenced muscle activation.  The Super Mini Gym utilizes a system of \\npulleys that allows for “slow, moderate and fast” contraction periods.  Subjects were \\ninstructed to give maximal effort at each speed, while the “Muscle Action Potential” \\n(MAP) was measured using surface EMG for the anterior deltoid, the pectoralis major, \\nthe biceps brachii, and the triceps.  Further details of the EMG collection process are \\nvague, describing only that the collection unit was able to measure “below the μV/sec \\nlevel” and that the unit output is an average, absolute voltage.  The authors found that the \\nselected muscles did seem to be active during the exercise and for the pectoralis major, \\nMAP decreased as speed increased through all three conditions.  For the other muscles \\n \\n \\n17\\nanalyzed, there was only a significant difference as speed progressed from the moderate \\nto the fast setting.  \\n \\nThere are a few problems with this particular study.  First, speed was not controlled in a \\nsystematic and quantitative fashion.  The authors used the “slow, moderate and fast” \\nsettings of the unit, but it is not clear how much the speed of the exercise changed when \\nincreasing the speed setting, or whether the increase from slow to moderate was the same \\ninterval as moderate to fast.  Furthermore, EMG data were not normalized in terms of \\nsignal strength (i.e. normalized using any of the previously discussed methods).  While \\nthe authors did not make comparisons across muscle groups, they did combine subjects \\ninto groups.  Combining subjects into groups using raw EMG signal will likely increase \\nthe within group variability due to some of the factors that influence EMG data \\ncollection, also discussed previously.  Finally, the authors converted the units of their \\nanalysis into millivolts/sec, however, they do not describe this process.  It is unclear \\nwhether the average value across the length of the trial was selected or a maximal value \\nwithin the trial (either instantaneous or for a given period of time) was determined, or if \\n“counts” were used. \\n \\n2.6.2  Electromyography and the “Sticking Point” \\nElliott, Wilson and Kerr published a paper in 1989 exploring the “sticking region” in the \\nbench press.  This term has been used two ways:  one is to describe the location within \\nthe lift that most failures occur (Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984) the other is to describe \\nthe portion of the lift where the vertical force applied to the bar is less than the weight of \\nthe bar (Elliott, Wilson, and Kerr, 1989).  Both of these tend to occur roughly in between \\n20% and 40% of the lift phase of a successful lift.   \\n \\nThe authors collected kinematic and EMG data on 10 elite male lifters performing the \\nbench press under a variety of loads.  The authors used the kinematic data to calculate \\nvertical force exerted on the bar.   The subjects were state up through national record \\nholders in Australia and were described as having maximal lifts between 150 and 245kg.  \\nThe authors looked at maximal lifts, lifts at 80% of maximal, and failed lifts.  While their \\n \\n \\n18\\nresults were useful as a general description of muscle activity during the bench press, \\nthey are not particularly helpful in their exploration of the sticking point. \\n \\nRegarding the EMG results, it is important to note that the authors gave subjective \\ndescriptions of the EMG data only; no quantitative results to support their findings are \\ngiven anywhere.  The authors state that MVIC data from each muscle was used to \\nprovide the authors with a “reference” level for subjective analysis, but there is no \\nmention of MVIC data collection in their methods.   \\n \\nThe authors state that EMG activity in the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoid and the \\ntriceps was “moderate and occasionally maximal” throughout of the descent phase.  \\nStrangely, the representative EMG time curve included in the article seems to indicate \\nthat there was no maximal activity during the descent phase.  During the ascent phase, the \\nauthors report that the primary movers contracted maximally at the start of the lift and \\nmaintained this level of contraction with little variation until the end of the lift.   \\n \\n2.6.3  Electromyography and Grip Width \\nIt has been suggested that grip width plays a role in the relative muscular contribution \\nduring the exercise as well as the maximal weight that can be lifted (Lehman, 1995; \\nBarnett, Kippers, and Turner, 1984).  Several studies have shown that a relatively wide \\ngrip width, between 180 and 200% of biacromial width, is optimal for maximal bench \\npress performance (Clemons and Aaron, 1997; Gilbert and Lees, 2003; Madsen and \\nMcLaughlin, 1984).  As grip width on the bar widens, both the range of motion of the \\nlifter and the final height of the bar are reduced.  Especially this second factor has been \\ndiscussed as one of the possible explanations for increased bench press performance with \\nan increased grip width (Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984; McLaughlin, 1985).   \\n \\nIt is generally accepted that increasing the grip width on the bar will increase the \\ncontribution of the pectoralis muscles, especially the pectoralis major, to the exercise \\n(McLaughlin, 1985).  There have been a few studies that have examined this theory and \\nthey have shown conflicting results.  Barnett, Kippers and Turner (1995) looked at \\nelectromyographic activity in the anterior deltoid, the triceps, the latissimus dorsi (the \\n \\n \\n19\\nauthors stated this muscle was chosen because some lifters mention it as a contributor or \\nstabilizer in the bench press) and two portions of the pectoralis major: the “clavicular \\nhead” which the authors consider the more proximal fibers; and the “sternocostal head”, \\nwhich the authors consider the more distal fibers.  They had six experienced but non-\\ncompetitive male lifters complete a submaximal lift at 100% and 200% of biacromial \\nwidth.  A unique aspect of this study was the selection of weight to be used for each lift \\ncondition.  Prior to data collection, each subject completed a test of 1RM strength at both \\nthe wide and the narrow grip positions in the protocol.  The lifts for this study were then \\nperformed using 80% of each position-specific 1RM load.  The results were based on a \\ncomparison of integrated EMG signal. \\n \\nThe authors found the EMG activity in the triceps decreased with the wider grip width, \\nbut so did activity in the clavicular head of the pectoralis major.  No consistent change \\nwas seen in the sternocostal head.   As the authors expected, the latissimus dorsi was \\nshown to be relatively inactive during the bench press. \\n \\nIn 1997, Clemons and Aaron examined the relationship between grip width and EMG, \\ncomparing relative muscular activity, based on a percent of maximum voluntary \\nisometric contraction (%MVIC), as the primary variable.  Grips widths of 100, 130, 165, \\nand 190% of biacromial width were chosen for this study.  Unlike the previous study, the \\nsubjects in this study lifted the same load in each condition. The load chosen was the \\ngreatest weight each subject could lift in the narrowest grip width condition.  Increasing \\ngrip width increased the activity of all of the muscles analyzed (biceps, triceps, pectoralis \\nmajor, and anterior deltoid), with no apparent differences between any of the muscles in \\nthe amount of increase.  More specifically, for the widest condition (190%), EMG \\nactivity was significantly different from both the 100% and the 135% conditions.  For all \\nconditions, the authors chose the weight the subject could lift at 100% BAB assuming \\nthat this was the weakest position.  The increase in EMG activity with the wider grips \\nsuggests that the muscles had to increase the intensity of their contractions to lift the \\nweight in the wide grip condition.  This might suggest that the widest grip condition was \\nthe weakest condition, exactly the opposite of the assumption the authors made while \\ndesigning the study.  The authors do not comment on this possibility.  They also found \\n \\n \\n20\\nthat, at least in recreational lifters, the triceps were loaded the most of all the muscles \\n(approximately 110% of MVIC) and there was no difference between the relative loading \\nof the pectoralis major and the anterior deltoid during the lifts (approximately 75% and \\n95% MVIC).  The biceps, which are not considered to be primary contributors to the \\nbench press, were only loaded at approximately 22% of MVIC.  The authors’ \\nmethodological choice to use the same load at each grip width limits their ability to \\ndiscuss EMG activity during maximal efforts at each grip width, which may be very \\nimportant for overall performance.  It is entirely possible that the relative activity \\nbetween the different muscles may have been different if maximal weights had been used \\nfor the wider grip width conditions.    \\n \\nSo it is interesting to note that not only did both studies have at least some findings that \\ncontradicted commonplace theory on how to alter muscular activity in the bench press, at \\ntimes also contradict each other.  A third study was performed in 2005, this time \\ncomparing narrow, mid and wide grip widths (Lehman, 2005).  The wide grip equaled \\n200% biacromial width, the mid grip was 100%.  The narrow grip was defined as having \\na space equal to the width of one hand between the hands.  The average root mean \\nsquare, using a 164 ms window, of an isometric contraction performed at the wide grip \\nwas used for normalized comparison for the different grip widths in the following muscle \\ngroups: the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major, the sternoclavicular portion of the \\npectoralis major, the triceps, and the biceps.  Twelve experienced but non-competitive \\nlifters completed this study.  No differences were seen in the upper (clavicular) portion of \\nthe pectoralis major as the grips width changed.  Activity in the lower portion of the \\npectoralis major (sternoclavicular) was statistically different only when the wide and \\nnarrow grips were compared.  Activity dropped 27% in the narrow condition as compared \\nto the wide grip.  Mean activity level dropped 18% for the mid grip, but this was not \\nstatistically different.  Activity in the triceps increased to 157 and 210% of that in the \\nwide grip as the subjects shifted to the mid and then narrow grips.   So this study showed \\nfurther support for the theory that the triceps are more active when employing a narrower \\ngrip, but the results for the pectoralis major remain mixed. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n21\\n2.7  Lifting Changes Associated with Load Variation \\nMost of the literature available examining the mechanics of the bench press has looked at \\nmaximal, single lift efforts.  It is evident, however, that the mechanics of a lift change \\nwith the relative demand of the load.  Early work by Hay et al. (1982) examining the \\neffects of varying the load in the squat found changes in the kinematics that effectively \\namounted to a technique change.  Their study involved subjects performing the squat at \\n40, 60, and 80% of 1-RM and found that, as the load increased, trunk inclination \\nincreased.  At lower loads, the greatest demand, or largest moment production, was \\nrequired by the knee extensors; however, at higher loads, this demand shifted to the hip \\nextensors. \\n \\nIn their examination of the sticking point in the bench press, Elliott et al. (1989) analyzed \\ntheir subjects’ lift mechanics at both 80% and 100% 1-RM load and found changes in the \\nmechanics of the lift that they describe as “radical.”  The force pattern of seven of the ten \\nsubjects in the study changed so that there was only an acceleration and a deceleration \\nphase.   The subjects had eliminated the “maximum strength region” and most \\nimportantly, the sticking region.  Since this is the phase where the force applied is less \\nthan the weight of the load and most failures occur, it is extremely unlikely that these lifts \\nwill result in failure.   \\n \\nThese authors revisited the topic in a publication later that year (Wilson, Elliott, and Kerr, \\n1989).  This time, their specific aim was to examine differences in single lifts using \\nmaximal and submaximal load.  They again studied 10 elite lifters, comparing bar path \\nand force applied to the bar at 80% and 100% of 1-RM load.  The differences in bar path \\nduring descent and lift described by Madsen and McLaughlin were observed in the 100% \\nlift, but for most subjects, greatly diminished in the 80% lift.  In particular, the pattern of \\nkeeping the bar more directly over the shoulder during the lift phase was no longer \\nobservable in the 80% lift.  Also confirming previous results, the sticking phase and \\nmaximum strength phase disappeared in the force profile.  Instead, there was a single \\nmaximum force applied during a longer acceleration phase, and a single minimum force \\nduring a longer deceleration phase.  Again the absence of a sticking phase suggests that \\nlift failure is highly unlikely. \\n \\n \\n22\\n \\n2.8    Mechanics of Other Strength Training Exercises \\nThe literature describing the mechanics of other strength training exercises is limited in a \\nsimilar way to the literature on the bench press.  The most commonly studied exercise \\nother than the bench press is the squat.  There are some similarities between the two \\nexercises, i.e. bilateral movement which involve large muscle groups, and therefore, it \\nwarrants discussion here. \\n \\n2.8.1  Analysis of the Squat \\nMcLaughlin, Dillman and Lardner published a study in 1977 discussing some of the \\nkinematics involved in the parallel squat.  Their primary goal was to find a way to \\ndifferentiate elite lifters from those with less skill.  Their study included video analysis of \\n24 competitors at the U.S. National A.A.U. Powerlifting championships.  The subjects \\nwere divided into two groups based on performance.  The “elite” group were ranked in \\nthe top 7 in the world in their respective weight classes at the time of the competition \\nwhereas the “less-skilled” group did not have world ranking at the time.  The variable \\nchosen as the primary discriminator between the two groups was the vertical velocity of \\nthe bar.  The graph of bar velocity was first divide in two parts, with the divisor chosen as \\nthe time when the thigh segment reached its most horizontal position.  The time before \\nthis, titled the “descent” phase, was divided evenly into thirds, as was the time following \\nthis point, titled the “ascent” phase.  Similarly to previous findings in the bench press \\n(e.g. Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984), the less skilled lifters were found to lower the bar \\nmore rapidly as reflected by a greater peak downward velocity (-54.8 ± 6.1 cm/sec vs. -\\n5.7 ± 3.0 cm/sec) and a greater average downward velocity (discussed but data not \\npresented).  Regarding body kinematics, the less-skilled lifters also had greater trunk \\nlean, greater backward displacement of the hips and greater forward displacement of the \\nknees and the bar.  Again, these findings are discussed but actual data was not presented.  \\nThe primary finding in the ascent phase was the less-skilled group leaned forward at the \\nbeginning of the ascent phase more than the elite group.  This occurred even though they \\nalready had greater trunk lean that had carried over from the descent phase. \\n \\n \\n \\n23\\nThe authors include a discussion about the applicability of their research, primarily \\nfocusing on the homogeneity of the group.  They suggest that the differences they found \\ncould be important for performance evaluation at the highest level of competition and \\nalso hypothesize that the trends they found would likely increase when looking at non-\\ncompetitive lifters. \\n \\nThose same authors also published a paper describing the kinetics of performing a squat.  \\nIn this study, they analyzed film from 12 of the competitors at the 1974 US Senior \\nNational A.A.U. Powerlifting championships described in the previous study.  No force \\ndata (i.e. ground reaction force, etc.) was available for this study.  The authors used \\nDempster’s anthropometric data and Plagenhoef’s data on moments of inertia for their \\ncalculations.  They did mention that the population in the study most likely displayed \\ndifferent physical characteristics from those used to establish those data sets, however, it \\nappeared that the errors in moment of inertia estimates at least were negligible relative to \\nthe total magnitude of the muscular torques. The 12 subjects were divided into two \\ncategories: world champions, high-skilled (top 10 ranking in the world), and less skilled \\n(ranked below 10 in the world).   \\n \\nBoth resultant joint torques and joint forces were calculated and they found general \\ntrends of differences between the two groups.  Both groups showed sizable trunk \\nextension moments, suggesting that this exercise is accomplished by more than the knee \\nand hip extensors, and the less skilled group showed greater trunk extension moments \\nthan did the higher skilled groups.  This finding is a logical extension of their report on \\nkinematics during the squat which showed greater trunk lean in the less skilled group.  \\nThus both reports suggest that reducing trunk lean and therefore the torque required by \\nthe back extensors is an important element at least in high level squat technique.   \\n \\n2.8.2  Isolating Muscles in the Squat \\nSimilarly to altering the grip width in the bench press to change the relative contribution \\nof the muscles involved, it has been suggested that varying foot width will change what \\nmuscles are more involved (e.g. Schwartzenegger and Dobbins, 1985).  McCaw and \\nMelrose (1999) examined the interaction between stance width and the relative load on \\n \\n \\n24\\nthe bar, and surface EMG activity in the Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis, Vastus \\nLateralis, Adductor Longus, Gluteus Maximus, and the Biceps Femoris muscles.  EMG \\ndata was sampled and then integrated in nine male recreational lifters as they performed \\nfive trials at each of three stance widths (narrow, shoulder width, wide) and two  different \\nbar loads (60% 1RM, 75% 1RM).  The 1RM load had been previously determined using \\na shoulder width stance.       \\n \\nMcCaw and Melrose (1999) found that increasing the load increased the EMG activity in \\nthe three analyzed Quadriceps muscles, but that stance width did not seem to have an \\neffect.  The integrated signal increase by approximately 20% as the load increased from \\n60% to 75% of 1RM.  For the Adductor Longus, increasing the load increased the \\nintegrated EMG value, as did increasing the stance width.  This supported the popular \\nhypothesis that increasing stance width increases the involvement of the muscles of the \\ninner thigh.  The Gluteus Maximus displayed a similar pattern of change as the adductor \\nmuscle, but only at the high load.  The Biceps Femoris was seemingly unaffected by the \\nload or stance width.   \\n \\n2.8.3  Tibial Shear During Leg Exercise \\nAn interesting topic of discussion is the use of open or closed chain exercise in both sport \\nperformance as well as injury rehabilitation (Escamilla, 2001).  Open chain suggests the \\ndistal portion of the limb, the foot in this case, is free to move, whereas in a closed chain \\nexercise, the foot remains nearly fixed.  One of the primary topics of discussion is the use \\nof the squat as a closed chain exercise in rehabilitation following ACL repair.  While this \\nconcept does not have a parallel for upper body exercise, it does warrant discussion.   It \\nhad been proposed that closed chain exercise, like the squat, is more protective than open \\nchain exercise, like the knee extension or even the leg press, because it reduces shear \\nforces across the knee.   In 1991, Palmitier, An , Scott and Chao showed that the squat \\ndid indeed reduce shear forces as compared to the seated knee extension.  It was not clear \\nat the time whether the improved force pattern at the knee was a result of the different \\nmotion, a single joint knee extension versus a multi-joint squat, or because one was an \\nopen chain exercise while the latter is a closed chain exercise.  In 1998, Escamilla, \\nFleisig, Zheng, Barrantine, Wilk and Andrews addressed this question.  They recruited 10 \\n \\n \\n25\\nmale subjects who were “experienced in weight training” to perform a free weight squat, \\na seated leg press, and a seated knee extension exercise.  EMG, video and force data were \\nrecorded during the movements and were used to calculate muscle activity and ligament \\nforces. \\n \\nThey found that calculated ACL forces remained zero for both the squat and leg press \\nthroughout the exercise.  Tensile forces in the ACL were present only near full extension \\nduring the knee extension, but averaged approximately 150N (peak force during \\nextension, 158±258N; peak force during flexion 142±258N).  Thus it appears the theory \\nthat closed chain exercise puts less load on the ACL is correct whether it is performed in \\nthe seated or standing position.     \\n \\n2.9  Specificity of Training \\nIt is commonly reported that a rapid increase in maximal single lift performance is often \\nseen following the initiation of a strength training program.  Furthermore, this rapid \\nincrease has been attributed more to an improvement in neural firing pattern than an \\nactual increase in muscular force output (Moritani and deVries, 1979).  This would \\nsuggest that the training pattern, plays a role in improving lifting performance.  \\nInvestigations into the relationship between specificity of movement and increase in \\nperformance have focused on training volume (specifically number of sets performed), \\ntraining velocity, and movement pattern. Each of these will be reviewed in the following \\nsections. \\n \\n2.9.1  Training Volume \\nMany training texts and manuals suggest that greater training volume will result in \\ngreater strength improvements (e.g., Carpinelli and Otto, 1998).  Studies of the effect of \\ntraining volume often compare single set to three set routines, with peak strength, \\nmeasured either as a 1RM weight or peak isokinetic torque, as the primary outcome \\nmeasure.  Berger (1962) showed significant improvement in training with three sets over \\na single set in the bench press, while Kramer, Stone, and Bryant (1997) showed similar \\nresults in the squat.  Both studies examined men and lasted 12 and 14 weeks, \\nrespectively.  Kraemer, Newton, and Bush (1995) later studied women performing \\n \\n \\n26\\nmultiple exercises in a 24 week study.  In this case, they found that single and three set \\ntraining groups improved through the first four months, but only the three set training \\ngroup continued to improve after.  These findings are not consistent throughout the \\nliterature, however.  Starkey et al. (1996) compared peak isometric torque and muscle \\nthickness in men and women following a 14 week program of strength training and found \\nno significant differences between single and three set training groups.  A similar lack of \\ndifference in strength improvement has also been reported by several others (Terbizan \\nand Bartels, 1985; Reid et al., 1987; Stowers et al., 1983).    \\n       \\nIn 2002, a meta analysis was conducted by Rhea, Alvar and Burkett to examine the \\nrelative benefits of single-set versus three-set training studies.  They explored all English \\nlanguage publications between the years 1962-2000 and found 16 articles that matched \\ntheir criteria.  Their  analysis revealed that three-set training did indeed result in a greater \\nstrength gains.  Furthermore, the effect was greater in the less trained subjects.  The \\nauthors hypothesized that as the subjects became better trained, a greater volume, i.e. \\nmore sets would be necessary to continue a similar rate of strength improvement.  The \\nquestion of volume is important however; typically, multiple-set training programs will \\nhave a greater training volume than similar single-set programs.  In the analysis by Rhea \\net al. (2002), when training volume was not controlled, the added improvement of three-\\nset training was decreased, as evidenced by the decrease in effect size from 0.70 to 0.25.  \\nThus from a research standpoint, controlling the volume of training is important for \\ncomparison.  Without this control, it can not be clearly stated whether any changes were \\ndue to the training style, in this case the number of sets, or simply the increase in \\nworkload.   \\n \\n2.9.2  Training Velocity \\nThe velocity of movement in training also seems to affect the performance gain.  \\nPublication of research in the area begins in the early 1970’s and seems to coincide with \\nthe introduction and then increase in popularity of isokinetic testing and training devices.  \\nThe reason for this seems to be that isokinetic devices offered a method of controlling \\nmovement velocity, something that is difficult in free weight and other isotonic type \\nexercise.  A common theory suggests that improvements in sport performance will be \\n \\n \\n27\\ngreater when training velocity is similar to sport performance velocity (Periera and \\nGomes, 2003).   \\n \\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine strength or peak torque gains at different \\nvelocities after training at either high or low velocity.  The results have been mixed.  \\nReports have suggested that slow speed and high speed training will improve strength.  \\nSeaborne and Taylor (1984) compared groups that trained isokinetically at slow (36° /s) \\nand high (108° /s) speeds.  They found that they higher speed training group had greater \\nimprovements in strength, as indicated by peak isometric torque.  The speeds chosen for \\nthis study were low compared to many other studies, which often employ speeds up to \\n300° /s (e.g., Coyle, et al., 1981; Smith and Melton, 1981; Kanehisa and Miyashita, \\n1983).       \\n \\nA recent study compared the effects of both training volume and velocity in a free weight \\nexercise program for 115 untrained subjects (Munn, Herbert, Hancock, and Gandevia, \\n2005).  For this study, the subjects performed either one or three sets of elbow flexion at \\na slow speed (approximately 50° /s) or fast speed (approximately 140° /s) for six weeks.  \\nA seated, isotonic elbow flexion test (1RM ) was used to determine peak strength.  The \\nauthors do not mention controlling or recording the speed of the 1RM lifts.  Higher \\ntraining volume resulted in nearly double the strength increase that was seen in the single \\nset training group.  Higher movement velocity also increased strength gains, though to a \\nlesser degree (11% greater increase compared to slow training).  There was not, however, \\nan additional effect seen by combining high velocity and high volume training for the \\nsubjects in this study.  The authors suggest that either program would provide the needed \\nstimulus for strength gains in an untrained population, but cautioned that more \\nexperienced weight lifters may benefit from a combination of higher volume and higher \\nvelocity training.  \\n \\n2.9.3  Movement Pattern \\nThere was no report evident in the literature that directly states that training with a \\nmovement pattern that is very similar to the desired movement will maximize strength \\ngains for that movement.  This seems logical, as it is clear that weight lifting performance \\n \\n \\n28\\nimprovement is not only due to increase in muscle size and force production, especially \\nin new weight lifters (Moritani and deVries, 1979).  There are numerous reports that \\nshow that training in a partial range of motion will result in position-specific strength \\ngains.  Kitai and Sale (1989) isometrically trained six female subjects in ankle \\nplantarflexion three times per week for a period of six weeks.  At the end of the training \\nprogram, they found a slight (35.1±0.9 to 35.5±0.8cm) increase in calf circumference, \\nwhich they assumed was due to muscle hypertrophy.  Voluntary force output, which was \\ntested in nine positions, increased only in positions that were ±5 degrees from the training \\nposition.  Interestingly, they also tested maximal evoked plantarflexion twitch force; this \\nforce, despite the calf circumference increase, did not increase at any position.  They \\nsuggested, because the amount of circumference change was so small (about 1%), that \\nthe force output increase was primarily due to a neural adaptation, not muscular \\nhypertrophy.  The lack of difference in evoked twitch force raises the question of where \\nthese neural adaptations might have occurred, but is not answered in this paper.  This \\nstudy, like several others, employed isometric exercise in the training program, whereas \\nmost people train using dynamic exercise. \\n \\nGraves and colleagues (1989) examined position-specific strength gains that result from \\ndynamic exercise.  They trained 28 men and 31 women who had not participated in an \\nexercise program within the previous year.  They divided their subjects into four groups, \\nthree of which trained on a Nautilus knee extension machine through a full or partial \\nrange of motion (ROM), while the fourth group was a control.  The three training groups \\nperformed one set of 7-10 repetitions of the exercise in the full ROM (Full Group, 0-120° \\nflexion), a more extended ROM (Extended Group, 0-60° flexion) or a more flexed ROM \\n(Flexed Group, 60-120° flexion). In this study, the improvements were still somewhat \\nposition-specific, but much less so than those seen in isometric training studies.  The \\nExtended Group improved force production, which was tested isometrically, at all \\npositions except 95° flexion and the Flexed Group improved at all but the most extended \\n(9° and 20°) test positions.  Thus it seems that while dynamic exercise improves force \\nproduction across a larger portion of the range of motion than does isometric training, it \\nseems to be important to train through the full range of motion.  This suggests that it is \\n \\n \\n29\\nbetter to train with a movement that best mimics the movement and positions that will \\neither be tested or be important for performance.   \\n \\n2.10  Summary \\nThe popularity of the bench press as a weight training exercise combined with the \\nrelatively simple motion involved should make it a good candidate for biomechanical \\nanalysis.  This chapter shows, however, that there has not to date been a thorough \\nbiomechanical analysis of the exercise.  The most successful research attempts have been \\ndirected toward vertical plane kinematic, and kinetic analysis of the bar only; and those \\nstudies that did examine kinetics estimated forces based on kinematic data.  Furthermore, \\nthe vast majority of data available thus far has been collected using male subjects, even \\nthough it is possible that there may be mechanical differences in the way men and women \\nperform this exercise.  Finally, most of the analysis of muscle activity seems to have \\neither been done before the current EMG analysis standards were developed, or have \\ninherent problems within the study design.  It seems clear that this is a topic that needs \\nfurther analysis.   \\n \\n \\n30\\nReferences \\n \\nBarnett C, Kippers V, Turner P.

While most \\ntraining regimens incorporate multiple repetition sets, there is little data describing how \\nthe kinematics of a lift change during a set to failure.  To examine these changes, 10 male \\nand 8 female recreational lifters were recruited.  The maximum weight each subject could \\nbench press (1-RM) was determined.  Subjects then performed as many repetitions as \\npossible at 75% of the 1-RM load.  Three dimensional kinematic data were recorded and \\nanalyzed for all lifts.    Statistical analysis revealed that differences between maximal and \\nsubmaximal lifts, and the kinematics of a submaximal lift change as a subject approaches \\nfailure in a set.  The time to lift the bar more than doubled from the first to the last \\nrepetition, causing a decrease in both mean and peak upward velocity.  Furthermore, the \\npeak upward velocity occurred much earlier in the lift phase in these later repetitions.  \\nThe path the bar followed also changed, with subjects keeping the bar more directly over \\nthe shoulder during the lift. In general, most of the kinematic variables analyzed became \\nmore similar to those of the maximal lift as the subjects progressed through the set, but \\nthere was considerable variation between subjects as to which repetition was most like \\nthe maximal lift.  This study shows that there are definite changes in the lifting \\nkinematics in recreational lifters during a set to failure and suggests it may be particularly \\nimportant for coaches and less skilled lifters to focus on developing the proper bar path, \\nrather than reaching momentary muscular failure, in the early part of a training program. \\n \\nKey Words:  weightlifting, bench press, training, technique, fatigue \\n \\n3.2  Introduction \\nThe bench press is one of the events in competitive powerlifting, as well as one of the \\nmost popular exercises among athletes and recreational weight trainers.  A large portion \\nof the literature available discussing the mechanics of the bench press has focused on \\n \\n \\n37\\nsingle maximal lifts.  Madsen and McLaughlin (1984) described in detail the kinematics \\nof the bar in single maximal lifts for world class power lifters; and then compared these \\ndata with the kinematics observed for a group of recreational lifters.  They found that the \\nbest performers moved the bar more slowly throughout the exercise and kept the bar \\nmore directly over the shoulder during the lift phase.  Other studies have focused on \\nspecific questions about single lift performance, including the optimum grip width \\n(Clemmons and Aaron, 1997), and reasons for lift failure (Elliott, Wilson, and Kerr, \\n1989).  Fewer studies have examined the differences between maximal and submaximal \\nbench presses.  Wilson et al. (1989) compared a maximal lift with a single sub-maximal \\nlift at 80% of maximum in elite lifters and found noticeable kinematic and kinetic \\ndifferences.  Most notably bar vertical acceleration profiles were very different between \\nthe maximum and sub-maximal lifts.  Also, the lifters tended to keep the bar more \\ndirectly over the shoulder during the lift phase at maximal load, showing a pattern similar \\nto the elite lifters discussed in Madsen and McLaughlin (1984).  There does not appear to \\nbe any examination of maximum versus sub-maximum bench presses in recreational \\nlifters; yet analysis of the parallel squat has shown that differences do exist in maximal \\nand submaximal parallel squat lifts (Hay, Andrews, and Vaughan, 1982). \\n \\nLifters seem to voluntarily modify lifting kinematics based on the intensity of the lift \\n(Hay, Andrews, and Vaughan, 1982), this may play an important role in designing a \\ntraining program.  It has been shown that, especially early in a training program, \\nperformance improvement is not strictly caused by increased force production in the \\nworking muscle (Moritani and deVries, 1979).  It appears there is a neuromotor \\nadaptation to the specific motion of the exercise that leads to greater performance than \\ncan solely be attributed to muscular hypertrophy and increased muscular strength (Komi, \\n1986).  This suggests that training with a kinematic pattern most similar to that desired in \\na maximal effort will improve performance gains.  However, differences may exist \\nbetween maximal and submaximal lift patterns, but there is no report in the literature of \\nhow bar path movement changes throughout a multiple repetition set of the bench press.  \\nSince most programs utilize multiple repetition training, the importance of these \\ndifference warrants attention. \\n \\n \\n \\n38\\nFrykman et al. (1988) examined the leg extension exercise and showed significant \\nchanges in performance across repetitions.  For their subjects, torque production \\ndecreased, as did power, angular velocity, and total range of motion.  If the mechanics \\nchange in a simple single joint exercise like a leg extension, greater changes may well be \\nseen in a free weight multi-joint exercise like the bench press.  If this is indeed the case \\nand the kinematics of the task change with increasing number of repetitions, the \\nspecificity of the training must be questioned, as can its training effect on a particular \\nmuscle group.  More specifically, assuming that development of a consistent movement \\npattern is important in training, it becomes important to know how the kinematics of a \\nmultiple repetition set vary from those of a maximal lift, and when in the set the \\nkinematics are most similar to those of a maximal lift.   The purpose of this study was to \\nexamine the effects of fatigue on the movement of the bar during a free weight bench \\npress, and to determine when in a multiple repetition set the kinematics most resemble \\nthose of a single maximal lift. \\n \\n3.2  Methods \\nSubjects for this study were recruited from an introductory weight training course.  \\nSubjects were tested to determine the maximal load they could lift in a single repetition \\nbench press.  Following this, subjects were asked to perform as many repetitions as \\npossible at a submaximal load.   \\n \\nApproach to the problem \\nPrevious research has examined the kinematics of a single repetition bench press, but \\nmost weight training programs involve multiple repetitions for a set.  Subjects in this \\nstudy performed both a single maximal lift as well as a multiple repetition set to failure.  \\nThe kinematics of the first and last repetition in a multiple repetition set were compared \\nto assess how the kinematics of the bar path change as the subject approaches failure.  \\nComparisons were also made with the maximal lift to determine when in a multiple \\nrepetition set the kinematics are most similar to those of a single, maximal lift. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n39\\nSubjects \\nEighteen subjects (ten male and eight female) between the ages of 19 and 23 (mean \\nheight 1.71 m ± 0.08; mass 73.7 kg ± 13.6) were recruited at the conclusion of a 14-week \\nintroductory weight training class at The Pennsylvania State University.  The subjects all \\nhad no previous formal weight training experience, but had during the course of the class \\nassessed their one repetition maximum test (1-RM) free weight bench press.  Those \\nvolunteers who had had no history of injury or illness that might affect lifting \\nperformance were recruited for the study. \\n \\nProcedures \\nPotential subjects attended an orientation session during which time the test protocol was \\nexplained, and questions were encouraged.  A signed informed consent was obtained \\nfrom all subjects; all protocols had been approved by the institutional review board.  \\nSubjects were then given time to practice lifting in the experimental set-up, and once they \\nreported being comfortable with the protocol a return visit was scheduled for data \\ncollection. \\n \\nUpon arrival for the data collection session, subjects were provided time for a warm-up \\nconsisting of both light cardiovascular exercise and the opportunity to perform bench \\npress repetitions with a bar of submaximal load.  Following the warm-up period, testing \\nbegan.  The subjects performed a maximum bench press, and as many repetitions as \\npossible at 75% of this maximum.  For all of the lifts the subjects were handed the bar by \\nthe spotters.  After accepting the bar, subjects were required to hold the bar still with the \\nelbows extended for 2-3 seconds.  Once instructed to start, the subjects lowered the bar \\nuntil it touched the chest.  Following a momentary pause the bar was raised until the \\nelbows were extended once again.  The execution of the lift conformed with the \\nregulations of the International Powerlifting Federation.  Speed of lifting was not \\ncontrolled, but as part of their instructions in the weight training course, students were \\ntaught to lift in a “slow and controlled manner”.  The two spotters were present at all \\ntimes during data collection. \\n \\n \\n \\n40\\nThe starting weight for the maximum load testing was equivalent to 85% of the subject’s \\nreported 1-RM.  After each successful lift a rest period of at least 3 minutes was \\nprovided, and the weight was increased by approximately 5% of the reported 1-RM.  \\nThen the subject attempted to lift the new weight.  This continued until the subject was \\nno longer able to lift the load.  The greatest load lifted was considered the 1-RM. \\n \\nFollowing the 1-RM testing, subjects rested for at least 5 minutes.  During this time, a \\nload equivalent to 75% of the 1-RM was placed on the bar.  At the conclusion of the rest \\nperiod, subjects were asked to perform as many repetitions as they could with the 75% \\nload.  The set was finished once the subjects reached volitional failure. \\n \\nData Collection and Analysis \\nA two camera Qualysis Pro-Reflex system was used to record the motion of retro-\\nreflective markers that were placed on the bar and subject.  These data was sampled at \\n240 Hz and later filtered with an 8 Hz low-pass Butterworth filter (Challis, 1999); \\nderivative data were computed using first order finite difference equations.  The markers \\nwere used to define bar motion in a sagittal plane.  The motion of the bar for each \\nrepetition was separated into two phases: descent and lift.  The start of the descent phase \\nwas defined as the point where continuous downward (negative) velocity began.  The end \\nof the descent phase was defined as the point at which the velocity of the bar returned to \\nzero.  The start of the lift phase was defined as the point at which upward velocity began, \\nand the end of the lift phase was defined as the time when the velocity of the bar once \\nagain returned to zero (see Figure 3.1).  Markers placed on the subject permitted \\ndetermination of bar position relative to the shoulders. \\n \\n \\n41\\n0.00\\n0.05\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\n0.30\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.0\\n1.0\\n2.0\\n3.0\\n4.0\\n5.0\\nTime (s)\\nBar Height Relative to Shoulder (m)\\n1\\n3\\n4\\n \\n2\\n  \\nFigure 3.1.

Note that \\nin this subject, the end of the down phase and beginning of the lift phase (2 and 3) \\nare nearly simultaneous.   \\n \\nFrom the data describing bar kinematics the following variables were computed to \\nquantify bar motion: time to lower the bar, time to lift the bar, mean and peak velocity \\nduring the lift phase, timing of peak velocity, and mean bar position relative to the \\nshoulder.  The time to lower the bar was calculated as the time from point 1 to point 2 in \\nFigure 3.1. The time to lift the bar was calculated as the time from point 3 to point 4 in \\nFigure 3.1.  \\n \\nTwo measures of the path of the bar during the lift phase were also analyzed.  The first \\nmeasure, the path length ratio (PLR) was an indicator of the straightness of the path that \\nthe bar followed.   The length of actual path the bar traveled (A) was compared to the \\n \\n \\n42\\nlength of a theoretical straight line connecting the start and end points of the lift phase \\n(S).  The equation used was, \\n \\n \\n⎟\\n⎠\\n⎞\\n⎜\\n⎝\\n⎛\\n=\\nS\\nA\\nPLR\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[1] \\nA value of 1.0 would indicate that bar had followed a straight line.  The second measure, \\nbar path deviation (BPD) compared the maximum perpendicular distance the bar deviated \\nfrom a straight line (D) with the same theoretical straight line (see Figure 3.2) in the \\nfollowing equation, \\n \\n \\n⎟\\n⎠\\n⎞\\n⎜\\n⎝\\n⎛\\n=\\nS\\nD\\nBPD\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[2] \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.2.

Data from the maximal lift was compared with the same measure for \\neach of the repetitions of the sub-maximal test.  The repetition with the least difference \\nwas selected.  Because the subjects performed different numbers of repetitions, absolute \\nS \\nD \\n \\n \\n43\\nrepetition number was not particularly meaningful.  To normalize this, the repetition \\nnumber was expressed as a percentage of total lift time, \\n \\n \\n⎟⎟\\n⎠\\n⎞\\n⎜⎜\\n⎝\\n⎛\\n=\\ns\\nrepetition\\nlift\\nnormalized\\n#\\n#\\n100\\n \\n \\n \\n[3] \\nThus, if the 5th repetition in a set of 10 was the most similar to the maximal lift, it was \\nsaid to occur at 50% of the total time for the set for that subject.  \\n \\nStatistical Analysis \\nOne-way repeated measure analysis of variance was used to compare metrics of bar path \\ntrajectory across repetitions.  Alpha was set at ≤0.05. \\n \\n \\n3.4 Results \\nThe means and standard deviations are presented unless otherwise noted.  The male \\nsubjects were able to lift a significantly greater absolute (89.5 kg ±17.0 versus 40.2 kg ± \\n9.5, p ≤ 0.01) and relative (110 ± 26 % BW versus 63 % BW ± 11, p ≤ 0.01) maximal \\nload.  For the remainder of the comparisons made there were no significant differences \\nbetween the male and female subjects, so only results for the whole group will be \\npresented.  The number of repetitions completed with 75% of their 1-RM load was 10 ± 3 \\nrepetitions (range 4 to16).  All repetitions were analyzed, however, because the subjects \\nperformed different numbers of repetitions, the first and last repetitions were selected for \\nstatistical comparison.  Table 3.1 presents the data for the first and last repetitions of the \\nset to failure. \\n \\n3.4.1  Kinematic Changes in a Set to Failure \\nSeveral changes were observed in the bar velocity pattern as subjects progressed from the \\nfirst to last repetition.  With the exception of the time to lower the bar (Descent Time), all \\nof the variables examined showed significant differences from first to last repetition \\n(Table 3.1).  The time to lift the bar (Lift Time) more than doubled from the first to last \\nrepetition, concurrent to a decrease in both mean (Mean Up Velocity) and peak vertical \\nvelocity (Peak Up Velocity). \\n \\n \\n44\\n \\nTable 3.1.

Analysis of the bar \\npath in the horizontal plane showed that subjects kept the bar more directly over the \\nshoulder as the number of repetitions increased (Mean Bar Position).  The horizontal \\nposition of the bar at the start of the lift phase change did not change (0.13 m ± 0.02 away \\nfrom the shoulder), showing that the change in the bar path occurred after the start of the \\nlift phase.  Further analysis showed that the bar path taken in the last repetition deviated \\nmore from a straight line (Path Length Ratio, Bar Path Deviation) than in the first \\n \\n \\n45\\nrepetition and is likely a result of the subjects’ pattern of keeping the bar more directly \\nover the shoulder in the later repetitions. \\n \\n3.4.2  Maximal Lift Kinematics \\nTable 3.1 also presents data for the single repetition maximal lift (1-RM).  It appears that, \\nin general, as the subjects progressed from first to last repetition, the lifting kinematics \\nbecame more like those of a maximal effort lift.  For Lift Time, Peak Up Velocity, Mean \\nUp Velocity, Path Length Ratio, and Bar Path Deviation, the first repetition was \\nstatistically different from the maximal lift while the last repetition was not.  The timing \\nof the maximal vertical velocity in particular did not follow this pattern and will be \\ndiscussed in more detail later. \\n \\nTo further explore when the kinematics in a multiple repetition set most resemble those \\nof a maximal effort single lift, the 1-RM data was compared to each of the repetitions.  \\nThe repetition that was most similar was selected and then converted to a percentage.  \\nThis number was averaged for all subjects.  Table 3.2 shows that the repetitions do \\nbecome more similar to a maximal effort as the lifter progresses though a set, but there is \\nconsiderable variation depending on both the subject and the measure. \\n \\n \\n46\\nTable 3.2.

It was expected \\nthat the kinematics of at least the lift phase of the bench press would change as the \\nsubjects progressed through a set to failure; in general this was supported.  Most notably, \\nthe time to lift the bar more than doubled.  With this dramatic increase there were \\nconcurrent decreases in the peak and mean upward velocity; however, the changes seen \\nin both the position and velocity profiles of the bar suggest that last repetition was not \\nmerely a slow version of the first repetition.  Two of the changes in particular suggest \\nthat there is a strategy change in these lifters as they approach failure.   \\n \\nThe first component of the strategy is the development of a vertical velocity curve with \\ntwo peaks, an early maximum and a delayed minor peak, in the lift phase.  This two-peak \\npattern is also present in a maximal effort single lift.  Figure 3.3 shows the velocity curve \\nfor a typical subject’s first, last, and 1-RM repetitions.  This two-peak pattern has been \\ndescribed by Madsen and McLaughlin (1984) in their analysis of world class competitive \\n \\n \\n47\\nlifters, and later by Elliott et al. (1989) in their analysis of the sticking region in skilled \\nlifters (those with maximal lifts of 1.27 to 2.16BW).  They describe the sticking region, \\nthe time when most lift failures occur, as being between 25 and 42% of lift time.  The \\nshift to an early peak in vertical velocity seen in our subjects may reflect an attempt to \\nenter the sticking region with the greatest possible vertical velocity, thereby increasing \\nthe likelihood of completing the lift. \\n \\nFigure 3.3.  Bar vertical velocity for the lift phase of the 1-RM, the first, \\nand the last repetitions of a representative subject. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe second component of the strategy was a tendency to keep the bar closer to the \\nshoulder during the lift.  It is possible that as the subjects began to experience fatigue, \\nthey might attempt to make their movements more efficient.  Since the bar needed to be \\nraised to the same height (elbows straight) for each lift, the first apparent option for \\nincreasing efficiency would be to reduce excess movement and move the bar in as \\nstraight a line as possible from the bottom to the top of the lift.  The data indicate that this \\n0.00 \\n0.10 \\n0.20 \\n0.30 \\n0.40 \\n0.50 \\n0.60 \\n0 \\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90 \\n% Lift Phase \\nBar Velocity (m/s) \\nFirst \\nLast\\n1-RM\\n \\n \\n48\\nstrategy was not adopted.  Both of the measures of bar path straightness, the length of the \\npath the bar traveled and the maximal deviation from a straight line, increased as the \\nsubjects progressed through the trial.  The second option, as suggested by Madsen and \\nMcLaughlin (1984), was to reduce the moment the bar created at the shoulder joint by \\nkeeping the bar more directly over the shoulder; this was observed.  It should be noted \\nthat their study involved the comparison of single lifts in world-class competitive lifters.  \\nThey were in fact, able to use this metric as a performance discriminator in maximal lifts \\nin athletes who were at the top of national and world rankings.  The population in the \\ncurrent study was not of such a high performance level, and they tended to develop this \\npattern only as they progressed through the multiple repetition trial.  Assuming this \\npattern makes the lift easier, it raises the questions of why the subjects did not utilize this \\npattern for every repetition, and how many repetitions they might have performed if they \\nhad used this lifting pattern throughout the trial. \\n \\nInterestingly, there was a trend to decrease the height of completion of the lift.  This was \\nnot a variable originally intended for analysis.  The instructions for the subjects were to \\nensure that the elbows were straight at the end of every repetition, and thus a nearly \\nidentical finish height for each lift was expected.  The researchers were careful to observe \\nthat the lifters touched the bar to the chest and then fully extended the elbows for each \\nlift.  Despite this vigilance the trend occurred.  While the change was not found to be \\nsignificant for the entire group (mean change ~1cm, p=0.06), it was strongly visible in \\nmany of the subjects.  The authors hypothesize that this may be a change in the amount of \\nscapular protraction that occurs during the movement.  This type of scapular movement is \\ndiscussed in studies analyzing the push-up exercise, especially when performing a “push-\\nup plus”, which has been reported as a beneficial rehabilitation exercise for the shoulder \\nin general and the scapular muscles in particular (Decker, et al., 2003 ).  Unfortunately, \\nthe kinematics of the upper extremity including the scapula were not available for this \\nstudy, so it could not be confirmed whether this is indeed what occurred.  \\n \\nThe last repetition had many similar qualities to the maximum repetition lift, for example \\nstatistically similar bar position, velocity, and path curvature.  Given similar velocity \\nprofiles, the saggital plane acceleration profiles should also be similar.  Despite these \\n \\n \\n49\\nsimilarities the forces exerted to move the bar for the last repetition compared with the \\nmaximum lift were less, because the bar had less mass.  This reduction in force indicates \\ndifferent muscular involvement in the last repetitions, indicating important \\nneuromuscular differences between the maximum repetition and the sub-maximum \\nrepetitions.  These differences do not support the concept that near maximum effort last \\nrepetitions in a set are necessarily similar muscularly to maximum effort single \\nrepetitions. \\n \\nThere are a number of potential limitations for this study.  The results may be specific to \\nthe subject pool used; further study with both more and less experienced subjects would \\nbe useful.  It is possible that the subjects did not actually produce a maximum effort on \\neither task.  The subjects all exceeded their previous maximums during the testing which \\nsuggests these were at least close to maximum efforts.  Fatigue from the 1-RM test may \\nhave influenced the second part of the test (maximum repetitions at 75% of 1-RM), \\nalthough none of the subjects reported they felt this was the case, and the number of \\nrepetitions performed was within the previously observed range (Zatsiorsky, 1995).  \\n \\nIt is commonly reported that an early increase in maximal single lift performance is often \\nseen following the initiation of a strength training program.  Furthermore, this rapid \\nincrease has been attributed more to an improvement in neural firing pattern than an \\nactual increase in muscular force output (Moritani and deVries, 1979).  This would \\nsuggest that the training pattern, or more specifically learning the proper kinematics of \\nthe movement, plays a role in improving lifting performance, especially early on.  If this \\nis true, then training with an incorrect pattern might slow progress.  Since most strength \\nimprovement programs involve multiple repetition training, it becomes important to \\nknow if the kinematics of the exercise change during a set to failure, and if they do \\nchange, when in the set the kinematics deviate away from the desired pattern.  If the \\nkinematics of the lift at the end of a set are dramatically different from the desired \\npattern, it may be beneficial to not train to muscular failure, at least in novice lifters who \\nare still developing the proper lifting pattern.  The data illustrate definite changes in the \\nmovement pattern throughout a set to failure, and that in general the kinematics of the \\nlater repetitions more resembled those of a maximal effort.  However, that finding may be \\n \\n \\n50\\nspecific to the population of subjects in this study.  The results of this study indicate that \\nmovement patterns vary between single maximum repetitions and repetitions in a \\nmultiple set, which highlights that specificity of training relates not only to exercise \\nselection but also to the same exercise performed under different conditions. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n51\\nReferences \\n \\nChallis  JH A procedure for the automatic determination of filter cutoff frequency of the \\nprocessing of biomechanical data.

For this study, 10 \\nmale and 8 female recreational lifters were recruited and asked to perform a maximal and \\nsubmaximal (80% of maximal lift) bench press.  These lifts were performed with a bar \\ninstrumented to record forces applied to it in the vertical direction as well as along the \\nlong axis of the bar.   To determine position of the bar and timing of events, three \\ndimensional kinematic data were also recorded and analyzed for both lifts.    Statistical \\nanalysis revealed the average force applied along the bar to be between 22 and 29% of \\nthe applied vertical force.  The profile of the lateral force tended to be similar to the \\nprofile of the vertical force in both lifts.  The absolute vertical and lateral forces were \\ngreater for the maximal lift than for the submaximal lift, but were not different when \\ncompared as a percentage of the load lifted.  Thus, it is clear that a substantial portion of \\nthe force generated by the lifter is applied along the long axis of the bar.  It is not certain \\nif this force is necessary to generate vertical forces or if, with training, lifters could \\nimprove performance by decreasing the amount of force applied in the lateral direction. \\n \\n \\n4.2  Introduction \\nMillions of people, ranging from competitive weight lifters to senior citizens, include \\nweight training as part of an exercise program.  Reasons for training include improving  \\nsport performance, muscular strength, endurance, physique, self image, and delaying the \\ndecline in ability to perform normal daily activities that often accompanies advanced age.  \\nThe bench press, while enormously popular, is relatively simple to perform and involves \\n \\n \\n54\\na large portion of the major muscles of the upper body.   Therefore, it is included in \\nprograms designed for both competitive and recreational lifters alike. \\n \\nThe fundamental concept in weight lifting is to apply a force against a resistance which, \\nwith repetition, evokes a training response that develops and maintains skeletal muscle.  \\nMadsen and McLaughlin (1984), and Lander et al. (1985) have described the vertical \\nforces applied to the bar during the bench press in elite and skilled lifters, respectively.  \\nAccording to Lander et al. (1985), the typical vertical force pattern during the lift phase, \\nthat is raising the bar from the chest, of a bench press repetition can be divided into four \\nphases (Figure 4.1).  The first, the acceleration phase, involves an early peak occurring at \\nabout 5% total lift time (LT) and lasts to about 16% LT.  This phase is followed by a \\nperiod where the force applied is less than the weight of the bar.  This phase lasts from 16 \\nto 42% LT and is termed the “sticking region.”  Because the force is less than the weight \\nbeing lifted, the bar tends to lose upward velocity.  Should the velocity go to zero before \\nthe lifter is able to once again apply a force greater than the weight of the bar, the lift will \\nfail.  Therefore this phase corresponds with the popular concept of a “sticking point” in \\nthe bench press where lifts fail.  Elliott et al. (1989) however, showed that a failed lift still \\ndisplays all four phases of the lift.  Thus, it seems, the sticking region is not necessarily \\nwhere the lift fails.  During the third phase of the lift, from 42 to 82% LT, the force \\napplied to the bar is once again greater than the weight of the bar and is termed the \\nmaximum strength region, though the rationale for the name of this phase was not \\nprovided.  The final phase, occurring during the last 18% LT is the deceleration phase \\nand once again, the force applied to the bar drops below the weight of the bar.  This \\ncontinues until the force returns to 100% of the bar weight and the movement ends.    \\n \\nThe force applied to the bar by the lifter is not likely to be a purely vertical force.  It is \\nmore likely that there is also a lateral force applied along the long axis of the bar.  There \\nis no report in the literature of the magnitude of the lateral force applied during the bench \\npress.  Previous research has shown that there is a lateral component to the force applied \\n \\n \\n55\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n1.2\\n1.4\\nTime (s)\\nForce (N)\\nA\\nS\\nM\\nD\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nto the floor during a push-up (Duffey and Zatsiorsky, 2003).  Given the similarities in the \\ntwo exercises, it is hypothesized that there is a lateral component to the resultant force \\napplied by the lifter to the bar in the bench press.  While it would be presumably more \\nefficient to exert a purely vertical force on the bar, maybe it is not possible to generate a \\nlarge vertical force without a lateral component.  This may be expected due to the \\nmusculoskeletal architecture of the torso and upper extremity.  Therefore, the purpose of \\nthis study was to determine the vertical force and the force applied by the lifter along the \\nlong axis of the bar during a maximal and a submaximal effort bench press.  Since most \\nweight training is performed with multiple repetitions, a lift performed at submaximal \\nload was examined to explore variations between maximal and submaximal lifts.  \\n \\n4.3  Methods \\nSubjects in this study performed a maximal and a submaximal single repetition bench \\npress (1-RM) on a standard flat weight bench.  The resistance selected for the \\nsubmaximal effort was approximately 80% of maximal effort.  Vertical and lateral forces \\nwere recorded and analyzed for both lifting conditions. \\n \\nFigure 4.1:  Typical vertical force curve during the lift phase of the bench press.  \\nHere,  A: Acceleration Phase, S: Sticking Region, M: Maximal Strength Region, D: \\nDeceleration Phase.

(1985). \\n \\n \\n56\\nEquipment Design \\nTo record the vertical forces as well as the forces applied along the long axis of the bar \\nduring the lifting tasks a steel sleeve was mounted along the grip portion of a standard, \\n20kg Olympic-style weight lifting bar.  The sleeve was instrumented with five uni-axial \\nforce transducers (PCB 208B03).  Three transducers were mounted horizontally at the \\nmiddle of the sleeve and were use to record lateral forces.  Two transducers were \\nmounted vertically, one at each end of the sleeve, and were used to record vertical forces.  \\nThis design necessitated a sleeve with a 1.75 inch outside diameter that was larger than \\nthe typical standard 1.1 inch (28mm) lifting bar but is similar to that seen in “fat bar” \\ntraining equipment that is often seen today.  A schematic of the bar can be seen in Figure \\n4.2.  For more detailed information on the bar, see Appendix A. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTo assess the accuracy and validity of the instrumented bar, testing was performed prior \\nto subject recruitment.  Known loads up to 400N were added to the bar in approximately \\n100N increments, the bar was suspended so that the loads were supported through the \\nBF\\nT \\nVR \\nBB\\nFigure 4.2.  A schematic of the instrumented bar designed for this study.  The two \\nvertical plates are connected via three horizontally-mounted force transducers.  The \\ngrip portion of the regular bar runs through the two sleeves and is suspended in place \\nby a vertically-mounted force transducer at each end.  A small “bridge” was built \\nthat extended up and past the end of the sleeve so that the transducer could be \\nmounted in a straight, vertical line.  VL and VR are the right and left transducers.  T, \\nBF, and BB are horizontal transducers.  The figure is not to scale. \\n VL \\n \\n \\n57\\nvertically mounted transducers, and force recording were compared to expected values \\nbased on the mass of the system.  Errors were less than ± 2N across all applied loads.  \\nThen, drift in the transducers was tested during a 5 minute data collection period.  During \\nthis period, no additional load was applied.  Force readings at the end of the 5 minute \\nperiod remained within ± 2N of the original values.  This amount of time was chosen \\nbecause it well exceeded the time any single experimental trial would take.  This amount \\nof drift was considered negligible for this study.  Nonlinearity in the transducers, as \\nprovided by the manufacturer, was less than 1% full scale.      \\n \\nSubjects \\nEighteen subjects (ten male and eight female) between the ages of 19 and 23 (mean \\nheight 1.71 m ± 0.08; mass 73.7 kg ± 13.6) were recruited at the conclusion of a 14-week \\nintroductory weight training class at The Pennsylvania State University.  The subjects all \\nhad no previous formal weight training experience, but had during the course of the class \\nassessed their one repetition maximum test (1-RM) free weight bench press.  Those \\nvolunteers who had had no history of injury or illness that might affect lifting \\nperformance were recruited for the study. \\n \\nProcedures \\nPotential subjects attended an orientation session during which time the test protocol was \\nexplained, and questions were encouraged.  Signed informed consent was obtained from \\nall subjects; all protocols had been approved by the institutional review board.  Subjects \\nwere then given time to practice lifting in the experimental set-up, and once they reported \\nbeing comfortable with the protocol a return visit was scheduled for data collection. \\n \\nUpon arrival for the data collection session, subjects were provided time for a warm-up \\nconsisting of both light cardiovascular exercise and the opportunity to perform bench \\npress repetitions with a bar at submaximal load.  Following the warm-up period, testing \\nbegan.  The bar was loaded to 80% of the subject’s reported 1-RM.  The subjects were \\nhanded the bar by the spotters.  After accepting the bar, subjects were required to hold the \\nbar still with the elbows extended for 2-3 seconds to establish a static baseline for data \\ncollection.  Once instructed to start, the subjects lowered the bar until it touched the chest.  \\n \\n \\n58\\nFollowing a momentary pause the bar was raised until the elbows were fully extended \\nonce again.  After a successful lift a rest period of at least 3 minutes was provided, and \\nthe mass was increased by approximately 5% of the reported 1-RM.  Then the subject \\nattempted to lift the new mass.  This continued until the subject was no longer able to lift \\nthe load.  The greatest load lifted was considered the 1-RM.  The execution of the lift \\nconformed with the regulations of the International Powerlifting Federation.  Speed of \\nlifting was not controlled, but as part of their instructions in the weight training course, \\nstudents were taught to lift in a “slow and controlled manner”.  The two spotters were \\npresent at all times during data collection.  Any lift performed with noticeable bar tilt was \\nrejected and performed again by the subject. \\n \\nData Collection and Processing \\nData from the force transducers was sampled at 2400Hz.   A custom LabView program \\nwas used to collect data from the transducers.  Data were passed through a low pass filter \\nwith a cut-off frequency of 5Hz.  This cut-off frequency was selected given the \\nmovement the bench press is a relatively low frequency movement, and it has been \\nsuccessfully used in previous research (Wilson et al. 1989; Wilson et al. 1991).  The \\nsignal was converted to Newtons using the conversion factor provided for each \\ntransducer by the manufacturer.  Total vertical force was then calculated by summing the \\nvalue of the two vertical force transducers.  Positive vertical forces indicate an upward \\nforce exerted by the lifter.  To eliminate any contribution of a bending moment to the \\nrecorded lateral force, the lateral force was calculated using the following equation:  \\n \\nLateral force = 1.5 y (T + (0.5 y (BF + BB)))                      \\n   [4.1]   \\n \\nT = value of top horizontal transducer, BF = value of bottom front horizontal transducer, \\nand BB = value of bottom back horizontal transducer.  Positive lateral forces indicate an \\noutward force exerted by the lifter.   \\n \\nKinematic data for the bar was collected with the use of retroreflective markers that were \\nplaced on the bar and a two-camera (Qualysis, ProReflex) motion analysis system, \\nsampling at 240Hz.  Data collection from the motion analysis system and the load cells \\n \\n \\n59\\nwere synchronized.  Position data from the bar was used to determine position and \\nvelocity of the bar, as well as start and finish times for each portion of the lift.  The start \\nof the descent phase was defined as the point where continuous downward (negative) \\nvelocity began.  The end of the descent phase was defined as the point at which the \\nvelocity of the bar returned to zero.  The start of the lift phase was defined as the point at \\nwhich upward velocity began, and the end of the lift phase was defined as the time when \\nthe velocity of the bar once again returned to zero. \\n \\nStatistical Analysis \\nVariables analyzed included the minimum and maximum force as well as the relative \\nmagnitude of forces during the descent and ascent phases.  The timing of the minimum \\nand maximum vertical and lateral forces, expressed as percent of lift time, were also \\nanalyzed.  The first lift, performed at 80% reported 1RM was compared to the maximal \\nlift.  One-way repeated measure analysis of variance was used to compare metrics.  Alpha \\nwas set at ≤0.05. \\n \\n \\n4.4  Results  \\nThe subjects in this study averaged a maximal lift of 63 ± 11 kg (90 ± 31% BW).  The \\naverage load lifted in the submaximal condition, which was set at 80% of each subject’s \\nreported maximal lift was 52 ± 9 kg (75 ± 22% BW) which averaged 83% of the actual \\nmaximal lift performed in this study.  A representative subject’s vertical and lateral force \\nprofiles during one complete maximal effort bench press cycle are displayed in Figure \\n4.3.   \\n \\nVertical Force \\nThe vertical force profile for the subjects in this study resembled those reported \\npreviously by Madsen and McLaughlin (1984) and Lander et al. (1985), with most \\nsubjects displaying the four phases in both the maximal and submaximal lift.  Table 4.1 \\nshows the mean and standard deviation of the variables analyzed for the lower and lift \\nphases of both the maximal and submaximal trials. \\n \\n \\n \\n60\\nThe magnitude of the vertical force during the submaximal trial was statistically \\nsignificantly less than that in the maximal trial (p < 0.01); however, the difference \\nbetween the vertical forces was not statistically significant when the two trials were \\nexpressed as a percent of the load lifted.  For example, the absolute maximum vertical \\nforce applied during the lift phase was about 22% lower for the submaximal trial (p ≤ \\n0.01), but when compared as a percentage of the load lifted, they were nearly identical \\n(115 and 113%, respectively).  The timing of the events during the lifts were also similar \\nbetween the maximal and submaximal trials with one exception: the time at which the \\nminimum vertical force occurred during the lift phase was significantly later in the \\nsubmaximal lift (p ≤ 0.01).  The two times during the lift that this is likely to occur are \\nduring the “sticking region” relatively early in the lift, or during the “deceleration phase” \\nat the end of the lift.  During the maximal lift, the minimum vertical force was relatively \\nevenly distributed between the two phases, with 11 of 18 subjects showing the minimum \\nvertical force during the sticking region.  For the submaximal lift, the minimum vertical \\nforce occurred during the deceleration phase for all but one subject.   \\n \\n \\n61\\n \\nTable 4.1  Group means and standard deviations for the analyzed variables for the \\ndescent and lift phases of both the maximal lift and the submaximal lift.   \\n \\nMaximal \\nSubmaximal \\nVariable \\nDescent \\nLift \\nDescent \\nLift \\nMaximum Vertical \\nForce (N) \\n772.5 ± 348.7* \\n832.8 ± 397.1* \\n607.6 ± 264.7 \\n651.6 ± 289.1 \\nMaximum Vertical \\nForce (% load) \\n107 ± 18 \\n115 ± 22 \\n105 ± 16 \\n113 ± 20 \\nTime to Maximum \\nVertical Force (%) \\n82.4 ± 29.0 \\n4.5 ± 3.2 \\n91.6 ± 15.4 \\n8.7 ± 4.5 \\nMaximum Lateral \\nForce (N) \\n208.2 ± 91.0* \\n235.0 ± 108.6* \\n152.8 ± 70.2 \\n167.3 ± 78.0 \\nTime to Maximum \\nLateral Force  (%) \\n42.7 ± 46.7 \\n20.2 ± 34.8 \\n63.8 ± 46.8 \\n17.4 ± 30.3 \\nMinimum Vertical \\nForce (N) \\n616.4 ± 264.5* \\n631.2 ± 261.4* \\n475.6 ± 192.8 \\n457.4 ± 206.5 \\nTime to Minimum \\nVertical Force  (%) \\n31.0 ± 21.2 \\n56.3 ± 36.0* \\n22.6 ± 14.7 \\n93.8 ± 14.4 \\nMinimum Lateral \\nForce (N) \\n159.2 ± 63.3* \\n163.3 ± 64.9* \\n116.0 ± 50.0 \\n106.9 ± 48.8 \\nTime to Minimum \\nLateral Force  (%) \\n58.5 ± 31.8* \\n42.2 ± 30.7* \\n40.2 ± 25.3 \\n87.6 ± 22.8 \\nAverage Ratio \\n26.2 ± 4.9 \\n26.3 ± 3.9* \\n24.1 ± 3.7 \\n23.7 ± 3.9 \\nRatio Range \\n4.1 ± 1.5 \\n5.2 ± 2.0* \\n4.0 ± 1.4 \\n3.8 ± 1.9 \\nPeak Ratio \\n28.7 ± 5.1 \\n29.5 ± 4.4* \\n26.7 ± 3.9 \\n26.1 ± 4.0 \\nTime to Peak       \\nRatio  (%) \\n28.2 ± 40.1 \\n50.6 ± 45.7 \\n22.0 ± 36.5 \\n37.0 ± 41.5 \\nMinimum Ratio \\n24.6 ± 4.6 \\n24.2 ± 3.8 \\n22.6 ± 3.9 \\n22.3 ± 3.7 \\nTime to Minimum \\nRatio  (%) \\n76.1 ± 17.2 \\n35.6 ± 18.9 \\n74.5 ± 14.5 \\n56.5 ± 33.5 \\nPhase Time (s) \\n1.7 ± 0.5* \\n2.2 ± 0.8* \\n1.5 ± 0.6 \\n1.8 ± 0.3 \\n* Indicates statistical difference between maximal and submaximal conditions (p ≤ 0.05). \\n \\n \\n \\n62\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLateral Forces \\nThe lateral force profile in most subjects was similar to that of the vertical force, albeit at \\na lesser magnitude.

Previous research suggests that the force profile of competitive \\nlifters changes when performing a submaximal lift (Elliott et al., 1989).  Seven of the ten \\nsubjects in that study displayed only two discernable phases, acceleration and \\ndeceleration, during a submaximal lift.  The results of this study, which followed a \\nvirtually identical protocol with novice male and females rather than elite competitive \\nmale lifters, did not necessarily agree with the earlier findings.  Most of our subjects (14 \\nFigure 4.4  The ratio of lateral to vertical force, expressed as a percentage of the vertical force, \\nfor a representative subject’s maximal lift.

If the vertical forces for the two lifts are compared as a percent of the load lifted, \\nthey are nearly identical.  However, it should be mentioned that, like the earlier study, \\nthese trends were not consistent across all of the subjects; three of the subjects did change \\nto the two-phase pattern described by Elliott et al. (1989), and one subject displayed a \\npattern with three distinct maxima and minima.  While the intensity of the submaximal \\nlifts were similar in both studies, with the subjects performing a lift at 80% of self-\\nreported maximum, clearly the skill level of the subjects was not.  While the mass of each \\nsubject is not provided, the weight class for competition and maximum load lifted are.  In \\nthat study, the subjects lifted 190% of their reported weight class.  If we presume their \\nlifters’ body weights are close to their weight classes, those subjects were almost twice as \\nstrong as the male, and three times as strong as the female subjects in this study, who \\nlifted an average of 110% and 65% BW, respectively.   \\n \\nThe variability between the subjects in this study may be related to differences in their \\nlifting ability.  To explore whether skill had an influence on the ratio between the vertical \\nand later force, lifting level (using percent body weight lifted as our indicator of lifting \\nlevel) was correlated with the average and range for the vertical and lateral force ratio.    \\nThere were no significant correlations between lifting ability and any of the variables \\ncompared.  The r2 values ranged from 0.05 to < 0.01, suggesting that the variability seen \\nin our population was due to something other than lifting ability.  It would be interesting \\nin future studies to record multiple lifts in both experienced and novice lifters to \\ndetermine if there is more variability in the performance of the less experienced lifters.  \\n \\nThe lateral force profile followed that of the vertical force quite closely in most subjects.  \\nCorrelation of the lateral and vertical forces during the lift phase resulted in a r2 of 0.7 or \\ngreater for 11 of 18 subjects.  The magnitude of the lateral force averaged about one \\nquarter that of the vertical force (26% for the maximal lift, 24% for the submaximal lift).  \\nThe position of the hands relative to the shoulder could influence the relative magnitude \\nof the lateral force.  More specifically, it was expected that there would be a greater \\nlateral force when the bar was low because the hands are more lateral to the shoulders, \\nand there would be less lateral force at the top of the lift when the hands are more vertical \\n \\n \\n65\\nto the shoulders.  This was not typically the case.  There was a tendency for a greater \\nrelative lateral force at the beginning of the lift phase, followed by a rapid decrease \\nlasting through the first 15% of the lift, but then the lateral force tended to increase \\nrelative to the vertical throughout the rest of the lift. Therefore, linear correlation between \\nthe ratio of force magnitude and lift height showed virtually no relationship (r2 ≤ 0.05).   \\n \\nGiven that about 25% of the force recorded is applied in the lateral direction raises \\nquestions about the importance of efficiency in performing a bench press.  It would seem \\nlogical that the greatest load could be lifted when all of the force is applied vertically.  \\nAny force applied along the bar will not directly contribute to moving the weight in a \\nvertical direction.  This would suggest that teaching lifters to apply a more vertical force \\nwould improve bench press performance.  A simple option for this would be training with \\ndumbbells.  A straight bar will resist and therefore mask any lateral forces as long as they \\nare equal in each direction along the bar.  Since dumbbells have no fixed attachment, a \\nlateral force would result in the dumbbells moving away from each other.  Thus, this \\nwould seem like a good training feedback system.   \\n \\nImmediately, there appear to be two potential difficulties in training lifters to push more \\nvertically.  First, lifters are able to lift a smaller weight using dumbbells compared with a \\nstraight bar.  Therefore, training with dumbbells only might result in a reduced training \\neffect.  Second, better efficiency may not necessarily result in better performance.  It may \\nbe the case, because of the musculoskeletal architecture of the upper limb, that greater \\ntotal vertical force can only be generated when the force is applied in an upward and \\noutward direction.   At the beginning of the lift phase, when the upper arm is below \\nhorizontal (elbow below shoulder) adduction of the shoulder would create a force both \\nupward and outward.  Also, throughout the lift, but especially later in the phase, \\nextension of the elbow would also tend to create an outward force.  Indeed, this seems to \\nexplain the pattern seen in the ratio between the vertical and lateral forces as well.  If this \\nis the case, then the only way to apply a purely vertical force may be to change the \\nposition of the hands relative to the shoulders by reducing grip width.  Narrower grip \\nwidth, however, has previously been reported to result in a decrease in maximum lifting \\nability (McLaughlin, 1985), so this may also be an inadequate solution.  \\n \\n \\n66\\n \\nClearly additional research is necessary to understand the relationship between the \\nvertical and lateral force applied to the bar.  The next study will look at the effect of grip \\nwidth on the vertical and lateral forces.  Also, upper body kinematics and muscle \\nelectrical activity will be examined to try to determine what role they may play in the \\ngeneration and application of force in the bench press.  Understanding the relationship \\nbetween grip width, arm position and force application on the bar may help explain what \\nrole lateral forces play when subjects perform a maximal vertical lift. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n67\\n \\nReferences \\n \\nDuffey MJ, Zatsiorsky V.

For this study, eight male and \\nthree female recreational lifters were recruited and asked to perform a maximal bench \\npress at self-selected grip width, and five submaximal (75% of maximal lift) lifts at \\npredetermined grip widths.  These lifts were performed with a bar instrumented to record \\nforces applied to it in the vertical direction as well as along the long axis of the bar.   To \\ndetermine position of the bar and timing of events, three-dimensional kinematic data \\nwere also recorded and analyzed for both lifts.    EMG data were recorded for the \\npectoralis, the triceps, the biceps and the anterior deltoid.  Statistical analysis revealed \\nthat vertical force and lateral forces decreased as grip width increased.  Higher forces and \\nEMG recordings were observed in the descent rather than the lift phase.  Neither peak nor \\nmean EMG levels were systematically affected by grip width.  While the narrow grip \\nposition resulted in higher vertical and lateral forces, these novice lifters did not display \\ndifferent muscle activation levels when performing the bench press with a wider or \\nnarrower grip.   \\n \\n \\n5.2  Introduction \\nThere are several reports in the literature discussing how variations in performance of the \\nbench press alter muscle activity.  These studies have typically addressed one of two \\nhypotheses: that a wider grip width allows for greater weight to be lifted, and that \\nincreasing grip width places more emphasis on the pectoralis muscles and less on the \\ntriceps.  Several studies have addressed, and have generally supported the concept that, in \\n \\n \\n69\\nthe bench press, lifting performance increases as grip width is increased up to \\napproximately twice the distance between the acromion processes, or twice the shoulder \\nwidth, of the lifter (Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984; Wagner, Evans, Weir, Housh, and \\nJohnson, 1992; Clemmons and Aaron, 1997; Gilbert and Lees, 2003).  Wagner et al. \\n(1992), for example, showed that the greatest single lift performance was achieved at a \\nrelatively wide 200% biacromial breadth, and decreased when grip width increased or \\ndecreased from that width.  The explanations given for this suggest that performance is \\nimproved because the range of motion of the lifter and the final height of the bar were \\nreduced with a wider grip, thereby reducing the total work that had to be performed to \\nreach a fully extended arm position.  Additionally, this improvement in performance may \\nbe a result of a change in the relative activity, and therefore relative contribution, of the \\nmuscles involved in the lift (McLaughlin, 1984).   \\n \\nThe data addressing the effect of increasing grip width on relative muscle activity is less \\nclear.  Barnett, Kippers, and Turner (1995) attempted to differentiate between activity in \\nthe upper and lower heads of the pectoralis major and examine relative tricep activity \\nacross conditions using electromyography (EMG), while subjects performed lifts at 100 \\nand 200% acromial width using incline, flat and decline bench positions.  As they \\npredicted, the wider grip position elicited less activity in the triceps and greater activity in \\nthe pectoralis but only in the upper portion of the pectoralis, and only when performing \\nan incline bench press.  Activity in the lower portion of the pectoralis decreased with the \\nwider grip.  Clemmons and Aaron (1997) found higher electrical activity in the pectoralis \\nwhen the grip width was 190% of acromial width compared with 130% acromial or \\nnarrower grip width; however, this increase was observed in all of the primary movers \\n(anterior deltoid and triceps).   Most recently, Lehman (2005) found that the wider grip \\nwidth reduced triceps activity and pectoralis activity, at least in the upper portion of the \\nlatter muscle.     \\n \\nWhat has not been addressed is the change in force production in the bench press as grip \\nwidth is changed.  Chapter 4 examined typical vertical and lateral force profiles during a \\nbench press performed at a freely chosen grip width.  The goal of this study was to \\nexamine if the muscular activity and force profiles change as grip width is varied.  It is \\n \\n \\n70\\nanticipated, based on earlier literature, as grip width increases, the activity of the \\npectoralis will increase, the relative activity of the triceps will decrease, and the \\nmagnitude of the lateral force will increase. \\n \\n5.3  Methods \\nFor this study, subjects were first asked to perform a maximal, single repetition (1-RM) \\nbench press.  Following this, the lifting load was reduced to 75% 1-RM.  Subjects then \\nperformed single lifts at five different grip widths.  Kinematic data were collected for the \\nbar and the upper extremity of the lifter.  EMG data were collected for the pectoralis \\nmajor, triceps, anterior deltoid and biceps.  The forces applied by the lifter to the bar were \\nrecorded using a specially designed instrumented bar. \\n \\nSubjects \\nEleven subjects (eight male and three female) between the ages of 19 and 23 (mean \\nheight 1.73 m ± 0.08; mass 77.2 kg ± 14.5) were recruited at the conclusion of a 14-week \\nintroductory weight training class at The Pennsylvania State University.  None of the \\nsubjects had formal weight training experience prior to taking the class, but during the \\ncourse of the class had assessed their one repetition maximum test (1-RM) free weight \\nbench press.  Those volunteers who had had no history of injury or illness that might \\naffect lifting performance were recruited for the study. \\n \\nProcedures \\nPotential subjects attended an orientation session during which time the test protocol was \\nexplained and questions were encouraged.  Signed informed consent was obtained from \\nall subjects; all protocols had been approved by the institutional review board.  Subjects \\nwere then given time to practice lifting in the experimental set-up, and once they reported \\nbeing comfortable with the protocol a return visit was scheduled for data collection. \\n \\nUpon arrival for the data collection session, subjects were provided time for a warm-up \\nconsisting of both light cardiovascular exercise and bench press repetitions with a bar at \\nsubmaximal load.  Following the warm-up period, the skin was prepared for EMG \\nelectrode placement. The skin was shaved where necessary and rubbed with an alcohol \\n \\n \\n71\\nswab.  Disposable, bipole Ag-AgCl electrodes with an inter-polar distance of 2cm were \\nplaced superficially above the following muscles: the upper third of the Pectoralis Major, \\nthe anterior portion of the Deltoid, the lateral head of the Triceps Brachii, and the Biceps \\nBrachii.  A reference electrode was placed above the bony portion of the medial humeral \\ncondyle.  The specific location for each electrode placement was chosen following the \\nguidelines suggested by Cram and Kasman (1998). \\n \\nA high impedance, differential preamplifier with a standard gain of 500 was located near \\neach electrode.  Final amplification of the EMG signal was set independently for each \\nmuscle and each subject to maximize signal output without clipping.   \\n \\nTo provide reference data for relative magnitude of muscular contraction activity during \\nthe bench press tasks, subjects were asked to produce three, five-second maximum \\nvoluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) for each of the muscles analyzed (a total of 12 \\ncontractions).   Positions for the MVIC testing were as follows:  for the biceps, the upper \\narm was kept adjacent to the torso and the elbow was flexed to 90° with the hand \\nsupinated; for the triceps, the upper arm was again kept adjacent to the torso and the \\nelbow was flexed to 90° with the hand pronated; for the anterior deltoid, the shoulder was \\nflexed to 45° with the thumb pointing up (hands partially pronated); finally, for the \\npectoralis major, the shoulder was abducted to 90°, then horizontally adducted to 45°.   \\n \\nFor this data collection protocol, a single repetition maximum bench press (1-RM) was \\nfirst determined.  Following this, the bar load was reduced to 75% of the subject’s 1-RM, \\nsubjects then performed a single bench press repetition at the following grip widths:  \\n100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of biacromial breadth.  Marks had been placed on \\nthe grip portion of the bar in 1cm increments.  Subjects were asked to place the forefinger \\nover the correct width mark for each lift.  For all of the lifts the subject was handed the \\nbar by two spotters.  After accepting the bar, the subject was required to hold the bar still \\nwith the elbows extended for 2-3 seconds.  Once instructed to start, the subject lowered \\nthe bar until it touched the chest and then raised it until the elbows were once again fully \\nextended. If, in any lift, the bar did not touch the chest or appeared to have bounced off \\nthe chest, that lift was not accepted, and subjects were asked to repeat the condition.  \\n \\n \\n72\\nSpeed of lifting was not controlled, but as part of their instructions in the weight training \\ncourse, students were taught to lift in a “slow and controlled manner”.  The two spotters \\nwere present at all times during data collection.  All lifting was performed with an \\ninstrumented bar which permitted measurement of applied forces.  To prevent an order \\neffect, the sequence of the submaximal lifts was randomized for each subject.   \\n \\nData Collection and Processing \\nForce Data \\nKinetic, EMG, and kinematic data were synchronously collected and processed.  A \\ncustom LabView program was used to collect data from the transducers.  The electrical \\nsignals from the load cells in the instrumented bar were converted from millivolts to \\nNewtons using the conversion factor provided for each transducer by the manufacturer.  \\nData were sampled at 2400Hz and passed through a low pass filter with a cut off \\nfrequency of 5Hz to reduce the influence of noise in the data.  This cut-off frequency was \\nselected given the bench press is a relatively low frequency movement, and it has been \\nsuccessfully used in previous research (e.g., Wilson, Elliott, and Kerr, 1989; Wilson, \\nElliott, and Wood, 1991).  Total vertical force was then calculated by summing the value \\nof the two vertical force transducers.  To eliminate any contribution of a bending moment \\nto the recorded lateral force, total lateral force was calculated using the following \\nequation:  \\n \\nTotal lateral force = 1.5 y (T + (0.5 y (BF + BB))) \\n \\n \\n[5.1] \\n \\nT = value of top horizontal transducer, BF = value of bottom front horizontal transducer, \\nand BB = value of bottom back horizontal transducer.  Positive lateral forces indicate a \\nforce applied outward along the bar.  For an illustration of the locations of the transducers \\non the bar, see Figure 5.1. \\n \\n \\n \\n73\\n    \\n \\nElectromyography Data \\nA Bortec electromyography system (Bortec AMT-8) was used to collect muscle activity \\ndata.  The differential signal from the surface electrodes was sampled at 2400Hz.  To \\nreduce noise, data were first band pass filtered with cut off frequencies of 20 and 500Hz, \\nthen full-wave rectified, and finally passed through a low pass filter with a cut off \\nfrequency of 5Hz to create a linear envelope.  EMG activity in each muscle was \\nnormalized to the peak EMG signal in the MVIC trials, then compared across each grip \\nwidth condition, as well as with the maximal bench press condition.  \\n \\nKinematic Data \\nA two-camera (Qualysis, ProReflex) motion analysis system, sampling at 240Hz was \\nused to record the three-dimensional position of the retroreflective markers that had been \\nplaced on the bar, the bench, and the right upper extremity of the subject.  Specifically, \\nthese markers were placed on the subject in the following locations: 1) acromion process, \\n2) biceps brachii immediately distal to the insertion of the deltoid, 3) lateral condyle of \\nthe humerus, 4) mid-forearm between the radius and the ulna, and 5) head of the ulna.  \\nThe first three markers were used to define the upper arm, while the last three were used \\nto define the forearm. The middle marker on each segment (on the bicep or the mid-\\nFigure 5.1.  A schematic of the instrumented bar designed for this study.  The two vertical \\nplates are connected via three horizontally-mounted force transducers.  The grip portion of \\nthe regular bar runs through the two sleeves and is suspended in place by a vertically-\\nmounted force transducer at each end.  A small “bridge” was built that extended up and \\npast the end of the sleeve so that the transducer could be mounted in a straight, vertical \\nline.  VL and VR are the right and left transducers.

Three markers were placed on the end of the \\nbench to establish an inertial reference frame.  \\n \\nThe kinematic data were passed through a Butterworth low pass filter with a cut off \\nfrequency of 5Hz.  This frequency was again chosen based on previous research (Wilson, \\nElliott, and Kerr, 1989; Wilson, Elliott, and Wood, 1991).  First order finite difference \\nequations were used to determine vertical velocity of the bar, which in turn was used to \\ndetermine the start and finish times for each portion of the lift.  The start of the descent \\nphase was defined as the point where continuous downward (negative) velocity began.  \\nThe end of the descent phase was defined as the point at which the velocity of the bar \\nreturned to zero.  The start of the lift phase was defined as the point at which upward \\nvelocity began, and the end of the lift phase was defined as the time when the velocity of \\nthe bar once again returned to zero.   Joint angle positions were then calculated for the \\ndescent and ascent phases of each lift.   \\n \\nFor kinematic analysis, the rotation axes were defined to conform with the guidelines set \\nforth by the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) (Wu et al., 2005).  The bench \\nwas chosen as the reference frame for relative motion and the following axes definitions \\nwere used:  the X axis was vertical, the Y axis was along the length of the bench and the \\nZ axis was across the bench (Figure 5.2).  For the humerus the following axes definitions \\nwere used (assuming anatomical position): the X axis was anterior-posterior, the Y axis \\nwas the long axis of the bone, and the Z axis ran in a mediolateral direction.  For the \\nforearm the definitions were the same as the upper arm (again assuming anatomical \\nposition).  \\n \\nRotation sequences were also chosen to conform with ISB guidelines, though with one \\nexception.  Shoulder rotations were calculated as position of the upper arm (humerus) \\nrelative to the bench rather than relative to the torso.  Because of the position of the \\nsubject, the presence of the bench and two spotters, and the number of cameras available \\nfor analysis, it was not practical to place markers to develop a torso segment.  Instead, the \\nposition of the bench was used and assumed to be parallel to the position of the torso.  \\n \\n \\n75\\nThe order of rotations, as per ISB guidelines for the shoulder was (with the positive \\nrotation as an example in parentheses): 1) rotation about the Z axis of the bench (forward \\nflexion of the shoulder), 2) rotation about the X axis of the upper arm (abduction of the \\nshoulder), 3) rotation about the Y axis of the upper arm (internal rotation of the upper \\narm).   The order of rotations, as per ISB guidelines for the elbow was (with the positive \\nrotation as an example in parentheses): 1) rotation about the Z axis of the upper arm \\n(flexion of the elbow), 2) rotation about the X axis of the forearm (referred to as the \\n“carrying angle”, this will not be reported), 3) rotation about the Y axis of the forearm \\n(external rotation of the forearm).  Two angular position measures were made for the \\nforearm segment.  The “forearm angle” was determined by the position of the hand \\nrelative to the elbow in a vertical plane passing through the long axis of the bar.  A \\nnegative angle indicated that the hand was inside the elbow (hands closer to each other \\nthan the elbows).  The “forearm tilt” was perpendicular to the previous angle, so that a \\nnegative angle indicated that the bar was above but between the elbow and the shoulder.  \\n \\n \\n                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Y\\n  Z \\n Y\\n      \\nZ \\nFigure 5.2  Axis orientations for the upper arm, the forearm, and the bench.

Kinematic data of the \\nsubject analyzed included shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and orientation of the \\nforearm relative to vertical.  Specific variables analyzed included shoulder abduction \\n(rotation away from the trunk) and flexion (rotation away from vertical), elbow flexion, \\nforearm orientation at the start and finish of each lift phase, as well as total range of \\nmotion (ROM) for each lift.  Muscular activity variables analyzed included peak and \\nmean EMG activity (expressed as a percent of the maximal value during MVIC \\ncontraction and/or the maximal lift) as well as timing of peak EMG in each of the \\nmuscles during the descent and ascent phase of each lift.  Force variables analyzed \\nincluded peak and mean vertical and lateral force, and the timing of the peak vertical and \\nlateral forces, expressed as percent of lift time and percent of lift height.  Alpha was set at \\n≤0.05. \\n \\n5.4  Results \\nThe subjects in this study averaged a maximal lift of 63 ± 11 kg (98 ± 33% BW).  The \\ngrip width, which was self-selected for the maximal condition, averaged 169 ± 28% BAB \\n(range 117-214%).  Group means and standard deviations for the metrics of the maximal \\nand five submaximal lifts, performed at grip widths of 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200% \\nBAB are presented in the Tables 5.1 through 5.8.   \\n \\n5.4.1 Kinematic Data \\nBar Kinematics \\nThe vertical distance that the bar was lifted increased significantly as grip width \\nnarrowed.  Subjects lifted the bar 7 ± 2cm higher in the narrowest condition than in the \\nwidest condition, representing a 24 ± 8% increase in the distance the bar had to travel \\n(Table 5.1).  Furthermore, the distance the bar traveled was greater in the lift phase than \\nin the descent phase.  \\n \\n \\n \\n77\\nLift time tended to be shorter as grip widened, at least when comparing with the \\nnarrowest condition, but this change was not consistent across all grip widths. During the \\ndescent phase, the mean velocity of the bar tended to decrease as grip widened, but again \\nthis change was not consistent across all conditions.  During the lift phase, there were no \\nconsistent changes in bar velocity across grip width conditions, but was much lower in \\nthe maximal lift than any of the submaximal lifts.   \\n \\nThe mean grip width chosen by these subjects for the maximal condition was a relatively \\nwide grip (168 ± 28% BAB); however, the range of grips chosen varied from the \\nnarrowest grip at 117% BAB to the widest at 217% BAB.   \\n \\n \\n \\n78\\nTable 5.1  Group means and standard deviations for kinematics of the bar.

Since \\nsubjects were instructed to raise the bar until the elbows were fully extended, the \\ndecreased elbow flexion at the bottom of the wider grip widths also represents an \\ndecrease in total ROM at the elbow.  Shoulder flexion ROM also decreased as grip width \\nincreased (Table 5.2).   \\n \\n \\n \\n79\\nForearm angle changed from -24.7° (hands inside elbows) in the narrowest condition to \\n9.8° (hands outside elbows) in the widest condition at the bottom of the lift and from 0.3° \\nto 20.2° at the top of the lift.  Forearm tilt also showed small yet significant differences \\nbetween grip width conditions.  In general, the subjects kept the bar between the elbows \\nand the shoulders.  Though the mean tilt angle during the lift phase was smaller than 5° \\nfor all conditions, as the grip width narrowed, the subjects tended to keep the bar more \\ndirectly above the elbows (Table 5.3). \\n \\n \\n80\\n \\nTable 5.2  Group means and standard deviations for kinematics of the shoulder and \\nelbow.

Both tables \\nshow that the vertical and lateral forces tended to decrease as the grip width increased.  \\nComparison between the two tables shows that the maximal vertical and lateral forces \\nwere greater in the descent phase than in the lift phase.  This was also true for the mean \\nvertical force, but the mean lateral forces were not significantly different between the two \\n \\n \\n82\\nphases of the lift.  Throughout all phases of all lifts, the lateral force was applied outward \\nalong the bar.   \\n \\nThe maximal vertical force tended to occur between 75 and 85% of the total decent phase \\ntime and did not change significantly across the any of the conditions.  During the lift \\nphase, there tended to be two peaks in vertical force, one occurring in the first 20% of the \\nlift, and one occurring in the last 35% of the lift.  For the narrower grip widths, about half \\nof the subjects had a greater first vertical peak and a similar number had a greater late \\nvertical peak force.  Therefore, the mean time for the vertical force was close to the \\nmidpoint of the lift phase in the narrowest grip.  As grip width increased, the early peak \\nbecame more dominant, to the point where the early peak force was greater in all subjects \\nat the widest grip condition.   \\n \\nThe maximum lateral force profile tended to have two peaks during the descent phase, \\none occurring in the first 25% and the second one in the last 25% of the phase.  For most \\nsubjects, the later peak was greater than the earlier in the submaximal lifts; however, this \\nwas not always the case, and therefore, there is a substantial standard deviation for this \\nmeasure.  During the descent phase of the maximal attempt, the earlier lateral force \\nmaximum tended to be greater.    During the lift phase, the maximum lateral force occurs \\nat approximately 75% of the lift time and does not significantly vary across grip \\nconditions; however, in the maximal lift, the timing of the maximum lateral force tended \\nto coincide with the maximum vertical force, at about 30% lift time.   \\n \\nThe ratio of lateral to vertical force showed small yet significant changes as grip \\nwidened.

Table 5.6 shows the \\nmean and maximum EMG value for the lift phase of the maximal trial.  The pectoralis \\nwas the most highly active muscle, followed by the deltoid, the triceps, and finally the \\nbiceps.  For the remainder of the EMG analysis, the data were normalized to the \\nmaximum EMG recording during the lift phase of the maximal trial for each respective \\nmuscle and are presented in Tables 5.7 and 5.8.  Figure 5.3 shows the EMG patterns for a \\nsubject under the 150% BAB condition. \\n \\nDeltoid \\nThe EMG activity in the deltoid tended to be very consistent across conditions in both the \\ndescent and lift phases.  Deltoid peak activity ranged between 80 and 95% of that in the \\nmaximal lift phase, and tended to happen at roughly the midpoint in both the descent and \\nlift phase.  The mean activity level was also consistent at about 45% of maximal activity, \\nthough the mean activity level in the lift phase of the maximal condition was significantly \\nhigher than that in the lift phase of the two narrowest grip width conditions.  There were \\nno significant differences in deltoid EMG activity measures between the descent and lift \\nphases. \\n \\nPectoralis \\nThe highest relative EMG activity in the pectoralis occurred late in the descent phase. \\nThe peak activity in the lift phase occurred early (less that 35% lift time) and was \\nsignificantly lower than that of the descent phase; however, there was no difference in \\nmean activity between phases.  Grip width had no significant effect on any of the \\nvariables analyzed, though the mean activity in the pectoralis was greater in the lift phase \\nof the maximal attempts than in the same phase of the submaximal lifts.   \\n \\nTriceps \\nPeak and mean tricep EMG activity were significantly greater in the lift phase than the \\ndescent phase across all conditions.  Grip width did not have a significant effect on tricep \\nactivity, though the maximal attempt showed greater peak and mean activity than some of \\n \\n \\n86\\nthe submaximal conditions.  Like the pectoralis, the maximal activity of the tricep \\noccurred late in the descent phase and early in the lift phase. \\n \\nBiceps \\nThe peak activity in the biceps muscles during the lift phase was about 25% of the peak \\nseen in the MVIC trial.  Throughout the submaximal trials, the peak activity in the biceps \\ndid not exceeded 45% of the peak seen in maximal lift.  Because of the very low relative \\nactivity level throughout all of the submaximal trials, the biceps was not analyzed further.     \\n \\nTable 5.6 Group means and standard deviations for the lift phase of the maximal lift.  \\nEMG values are normalized and presented as a percentage of the maximal value observed \\nmaximal voluntary isometric contraction.  \\n \\nBicep \\nDeltoid \\nPectoralis \\nTricep \\nMean Value (% MVIC) \\n12 \\n± 7 \\n44 \\n± 18 \\n54 \\n± 13 \\n38 \\n± 16 \\nMaximum Value (% MVIC) \\n23 \\n± 23 \\n82 \\n± 33 \\n109 \\n± 41 \\n72 \\n± 31 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n87\\nTable 5.7  Group means and standard deviations for the descent phase of the maximal \\nand submaximal lifts.

The \\nbottom half was defined as the initiation of vertical movement during the lift phase \\nthrough the midpoint, defined as the point at which the bar had reached ½ of the total lift \\nheight.  The top half continued from the point at which the bar had reached ½ of the total \\nlift height to the completion of the lift.  Lift height rather than lift time was chosen \\nbecause it was believed that any change in relative contribution would be the result of a \\nchange in upper extremity position rather than the amount of time of the lift.  The \\nmovement of a joint or the mean activity in a muscle in the top half of the lift was divided \\nby the same in the bottom half of the lift.  Therefore, a movement ratio less than one \\n(1.00) indicated greater ROM during the first half of the lift while a value greater than \\none indicated greater ROM at the joint in the top half of the lift.  Likewise, a ratio less \\nthan one indicated greater mean EMG activity in the bottom half of the lift phase and a \\nratio greater than one indicated greater mean EMG activity in the muscle during the top \\nhalf of the lift.  The ratio of shoulder flexion ROM was 1.01 ± 0.02, indicating that the \\nangular distance the shoulder traveled in the bottom half and in the top half of the lift \\nwere nearly identical, yet the ratio of mean activity of the two shoulder flexors was \\nsubstantially higher during the first half of the lift (pectoralis = 0.63 ± 0.14 and deltoid \\n=0.75 ± 0.13).  The ratio of elbow extension ROM and mean tricep EMG activity were \\n1.30 ± 0.02 and 1.17 ± 0.02 respectively, indicating that there was more elbow extension \\nand muscle activity during the second half of the lift.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n90\\n \\n \\n \\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n140\\n%  M a x  L ift P h a s e  V a lu e\\nPectoralis\\nTricep\\nDeltoid\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n140\\n0.00\\n0.50\\n1.00\\n1.50\\n2.00\\n2.50\\n3.00\\nTime (s)\\n%  B ar W eig ht\\nVertical\\nLateral\\n \\nFigure 5.3  This figure shows representative EMG and force profiles for a submaximal \\nrepetition at the middle (150% BAB) grip width.

A dashed vertical line has been \\nadded to indicate the transition from descent to lift phase. \\n \\n \\n \\n91\\n5.5  Discussion  \\nPrevious research has suggested that a wider grip width during a bench press increases \\npectoralis and decreases triceps activity (McLaughlin, 1985; Wagner, Evans, Weir, \\nHoush, and Johnson, 1992; Barnett, Kippers and Turner, 1995; Lehman, 2005), and leads \\nto a greater maximal single lift (Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984; Clemons and Aaron, \\n1997; Gilbert and Lees, 2003).  In the following section, the effects of changes in grip \\nwidth on the kinematic, the kinetic, and finally the EMG data will be examined.  It was \\nanticipated an increase in grip width would result in an increase in lateral forces and \\npectoralis activation and a decrease in triceps activity.  In fact, wider grip widths resulted \\nin smaller vertical and lateral forces and little change in muscle activation levels. \\n   \\nEffects of grip width on kinematic data. \\nOne of the reasons given for the decrease in performance with a narrower grip in the \\nbench press is that more work must be done with a narrower grip because the bar has to \\ntravel a greater vertical distance; the data in this study seemed to support this.  The bar \\ntraveled almost 25% further in the narrowest condition than in the widest condition.  The \\nincrease in lift height required an additional 20° of shoulder flexion and 25° of elbow \\nextension.  Position of the forearm was also affected by the width of the grip.  \\nThroughout all conditions, it appeared that the subjects tried to keep the elbows almost \\ndirectly below the bar with only a slight tilt, less than 5°.  The narrow grip resulted in the \\nhands being closer together or “inside” the elbows.  This relatively steep forearm angle, \\nas high as 25° in the narrowest condition, seems disadvantageous for applying a vertical \\nforce to the bar.  This position, as will be discussed in more detail later, was associated \\nwith an increase in both the vertical and lateral forces that were applied to the bar.     \\n \\nThere was however, only a moderate correlation between grip width (expressed as \\n%BAB) and maximal lift normalized to body weight (r2 = 0.37).  While most of the \\nsubjects in this study adopted a relatively wide grip position when attempting a maximal \\nlift, the mean grip width was 170% BAB, this was not always the case.  The subject who \\nhad the highest normalized maximal lift had the second-narrowest grip width (144% \\nBAB).   \\n \\n \\n \\n92\\nEffects of grip width on kinetic data \\nThe peak force applied during the lift phase of the maximal lift was about 8% greater \\nthan in the descent phase.  This is larger than the 1.5% difference previously reported \\n(Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984) however, this may be a result of a difference in lifting \\nstyle or in method of determining force.  Earlier studies have determined forces from \\nkinematic data rather than using force transducers.  Across all submaximal conditions in \\nthis study however, greater peak vertical forces were applied during the descent phase \\nrather than the lift phase.  There are two explanations for the discrepancy between the \\ntwo studies.  First, it may be due to a difference in methodology: their lifters were \\nrequired to perform a competition-style lift which required a pause on the chest, whereas \\nthe subjects in this study were instructed to perform each lift as they would in training, \\nand were not required to pause at the bottom of each repetition.   \\n \\nThe second explanation is that these novice lifters lowered the bar too quickly and have \\nto apply a relatively large force to stop the descent.  In the same paper, Madsen and \\nMcLaughlin (1984) report that the speed of the lift is predictive of relative performance \\nin elite, competitive lifters.  Specifically, the better lifters lowered the bar more slowly.  \\nCalculating mean descent velocity based on their reported time and distance of descent \\nshowed their expert group lowered the bar at a mean velocity of 9.6cm/s while their \\nnovice group had a mean velocity of 19.1cm/s.  Comparing those results with the data in \\nthis study shows their novice lifters lowered the bar at a very similar velocity as our \\nsubjects; however, there were still some substantial differences between the two groups.  \\nTheir lifters were all males and had an average maximal lift of 1.3BW compared with \\n0.97BW in the mixed gender group in the current study.  In addition to the gender \\ndifferences in the two studies, it seems likely that their lifters may have been more \\nexperienced, or at least more accomplished recreational lifters, compared with the current \\ncohort.  Because their lifters were substantially better performers yet still had not adopted \\nthe slower lowering technique suggests this technique may not be developed without \\nspecific instruction.  \\n \\nPrevious research examining the forces applied to the floor when performing pushups at \\nvarious hand width positions showed that lateral forces increased when the hands were \\n \\n \\n93\\nplaced farther apart (Duffey and Zatsiorsky, 2003).  The data in Chapter Four showed a \\nstrong relationship between the vertical and lateral forces.  This relationship was present \\nonce again in this study and was largely unaffected by a change in grip width.  The \\nmagnitude of the vertical and lateral forces changed similarly across grip widths and the \\ntimings of the peak vertical and lateral forces also tended to occur at similar times.    \\nSurprisingly, as grip width increased in this study, both the mean and maximum vertical \\nand lateral forces decreased.  Instead of showing a strong positive relationship with grip \\nwidth, the lateral force appeared to be much more strongly related to the magnitude of the \\nvertical force regardless of hand position.  Therefore, if lifting efficiency is defined as \\nlifting a given load while exerting the least force, it appears that wider grip widths \\nproduce more efficient lifts.    \\n \\nEffects of grip width on muscle activation \\nPrevious research has suggested that a wider grip width tends to result in increased \\npectoralis and decreased triceps activation (McLaughlin, 1985; Lehman, 2005), while \\nothers have suggested that such changes do not occur (Barnett, Kippers, and Turner 1995; \\nClemmons and Aaron, 1997).  Analysis of the data in this study showed that EMG \\nactivity was not systematically affected by grip width.  There were no significant changes \\nin mean or peak activation level in any of the muscles across any grip width condition.   \\n \\nThe lack of statistical difference in muscle activation between grip width conditions in \\nthese novice lifters has several possible explanations.  The first option is that the \\nsuperficial EMG data collection methods used in this study were not sensitive enough to \\nshow differences in muscle activation in this population.  The second option is that these \\nsubjects are not able to immediately change muscle activation patterns to accommodate \\nthe different grip width positions introduced in this study.  The third option is that muscle \\nactivation does not need to change across grip widths when lifting a constant load.  The \\nlack of consistent changes associated with a wider grip width points to this as the most \\nlikely explanation. Previous studies have shown both a statistically significant decrease \\n(Barnett, Kippers, and Turner, 1995; Lehman, 2005) and increase (Clemmons and Aaron, \\n1997) in triceps activity when grip width increases.  Furthermore, the study by Barnett, \\nKippers and Turner (1995) showed that activation of the upper fibers of the pectoralis \\n \\n \\n94\\nincreased while activation in the lower fibers decreased, whereas Lehman (2005) found \\nvirtually the opposite: no change in the upper fibers and an increase in activation of the \\nlower fibers.   \\n \\nWhile joint moments were not calculated in this study, some inferences regarding them \\ncan be drawn.  The moment about the elbow would be the result of the mass lifted and \\nthe moment arm about the elbow.  That moment arm would be related to the two forearm \\nangles measured in this study.  As seen in Table 5.3, forearm tilt, which was measured as \\nthe forearm angle perpendicular to the long axis of the bar, was relatively small and only \\nvaried a few degrees throughout the lift across all grip width conditions.  Thus the \\ncontribution of forearm tilt to the moment arm about the elbow was small.  The forearm \\nangle, which was the angle formed between the forearm and the long axis of the bar, \\nvaried greatly across grip widths.  At the bottom of the lift, the forearm was nearly \\nvertical (1.4°) at the second widest (175% BAB) condition; while at the narrowest \\ncondition, the forearm angle is almost 25°.  This increase in forearm angle would require \\na substantially greater extension moment to be generated by the lifter to extend the \\nelbows at least through the lower portion of the lift phase.  This increase in required \\nelbow extension moment, plus the previously discussed increase in the height the bar has \\nto be lifted, helps explain why narrow grip widths tend to result in smaller maximal lifts \\n(Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984; Clemons and Aaron, 1997; Gilbert and Lees, 2003).        \\n \\nComparison of Maximal and Submaximal Lifts \\nIt is also interesting to note the lack of difference in muscle activation between the \\nmaximal and submaximal conditions, even though the weight lifted in the submaximal \\ntrials was 25% less than the maximal lift.  Figure 5.3 shows the EMG and force profiles \\nfor a representative subject performing a submaximal lift at the middle (150% BAB) grip \\nwidth.  It is readily apparent that the activation of the triceps and pectoralis is close to or \\ngreater than that seen in the maximal activation for those muscles during the lift phase of \\nthis subject’s maximal attempt.  During the descent phase, only the triceps showed any \\nstatistically significant reduction in the peak or mean activation level between the \\nmaximal lift and any of the grip width conditions, and even those differences were small \\nand limited to the comparison with one narrow (125% BAB) and one wide (200% BAB) \\n \\n \\n95\\nposition.  For the lift phase, there were few statistical differences between the maximal \\nand submaximal trials.  The peak and mean EMG signal in the triceps was not different in \\ntwo of three of the conditions (125%, 150%, 200% BAB) and the peak pectoralis activity \\nin the two narrowest conditions were not significantly different from that of the maximal \\nlift.  There were no differences in peak deltoid activity between the maximal lift and any \\nof the submaximal lifts.   \\n \\nIt is possible that this lack of change in muscle activation is due to the increase in lifting \\nvelocity observed in the submaximal lifts.  The submaximal trials were performed at \\nroughly double the velocity of the maximal trial (22 cm/s and 11 cm/s, respectively).  \\nThis increase in lift velocity would necessitate an increase in contraction velocity of the \\nmuscles involved.  For example, the shoulder flexion range of motion for the 200% BAB \\nlift (54.3°) was similar to that of the maximal lift (55.4°), but was completed in half the \\ntime; therefore, the average contraction velocities for the pectoralis and the anterior \\ndeltoid should have roughly doubled when the subjects performed the faster lift.  This \\nchange in contraction velocity causes a reduction in force production capability of the \\nmuscles (Hill, 1938).  Therefore, because less force can be generated at higher muscle \\ncontraction velocities, the lack of change in muscle activation between the maximal and \\nsubmaximal trials may indicate that the “submaximal” grip width lifts may have resulted \\nin near-maximal muscle contractions.  \\n        \\nDifferences in Phases of the Lift \\nEMG activity was different, however, when lowering and lifting the bar.  The peak \\nactivation level during the descent phase was almost double that during the lift phase for \\nthe pectoralis.  The triceps showed opposite results; with significantly higher peak and \\nmean activity during the lift phase.  Therefore, it seems that in these subjects, the \\npectoralis was most highly activated when slowing the descent of the bar while the \\ntriceps was more active when lifting the bar.  Interestingly, EMG activity in the deltoid \\nshowed no significant differences in mean, peak, or timing of peak activity, between \\nphases.  This suggests that the deltoid is equally active when lowering and lifting the bar, \\nand its peak activity occurs very close to the middle of the movement, regardless of \\nwhich direction the bar is moving.  These trends are evident in Tables 5.7 and 5.8 but \\n \\n \\n96\\nwere not consistent across all subjects, including the representative subject whose data \\nare shown in Figure 5.3.  \\n \\nComparison of both relative joint movement and EMG activity between the bottom and \\ntop halves of the lift phases revealed interesting information regarding what is being done \\nthroughout the lift.  The shoulder flexion ROM was nearly equal in the first and second \\nhalves of the lift.  For the pectoralis, the peak activity occurred in and the mean EMG \\nlevel was higher in, the bottom half of the lift phase.  For the deltoid, the mean EMG \\nlevel was higher in the bottom half of the lift, while the peak activity level occurred very \\nnear the midpoint of the lift.  More elbow extension occurred in the top half of the lift, \\nwhich was also the time when the triceps were more active. Thus, is seems that the two \\nmuscles acting at the shoulder are more active when moving the bar through the bottom \\nhalf of the lift, while the tricep muscle, acting to extend the elbow, is more important for \\ncompleting the top half of the lift.   \\n \\nConclusions \\nThe narrower grips produced both greater vertical and lateral forces.  It had been \\nanticipated that there would be a strong direct relationship between the grip width and \\nlateral forces.  Instead, the increases in lateral forces were more strongly associated with \\nchanges in the vertical force which increased with a narrower grip.  The narrower grip \\npositions put the lifter at a performance disadvantage, which required greater vertical and \\nlateral forces for the subjects to lift the same bar mass.  More specifically, moving the \\nhands closer together increased elbow flexion which increased the moment the bar \\ncreated about the elbow, thereby requiring a greater extension moment to be generated by \\nthe triceps in the bench press.  Because the subjects were able to lift the same weight \\nwhile applying lower vertical and lateral forces in the wider grip conditions, it seems that \\nthe wider grip widths are more efficient for performing a maximal lift bench press.  \\nFurthermore, contrary to evidence in the literature, the novice lifters in this study did not \\nalter muscle activation levels when performing the bench press with a wide versus a \\nnarrow grip position. \\n \\n \\n \\n97\\nReferences \\n \\nBarnett C, Kippers V, Turner P.

It will first \\nreview the goals of the research project, then summarize the main findings, and finally \\nconclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings and possible directions for \\nfuture research.  \\n \\n6.2  Summary \\nThis study had three specific aims.  Each of these aims will be re-stated and then \\naddressed. \\n \\nAim 1:  To compare the kinematics of the bar of a single, maximal effort lift with those \\nof a multiple repetition set performed at 75% of the maximum load.   \\n \\nThere were statistically significant differences between the kinematics of the maximal \\nsingle lift and submaximal multiple repetition lifts.  Furthermore, the kinematics of the \\nsubmaximal lifts changed as a subject approached failure in a set.  The time to lift the bar \\nincreased from the first to the last repetition, this resulted in a decrease in bar velocity.  \\nThe peak upward velocity occurred much earlier in the lift phase in the later repetitions.  \\nThe path the bar followed also changed while lifting 75% of maximum, with subjects \\nkeeping the bar more directly over the shoulder during the lift.  In general, most of the \\nkinematic variables analyzed became more similar to those of the maximal lift as the \\nsubjects progressed through the set with 75% of maximum.   \\n \\nAim 2:  To examine the vertical and lateral forces exerted by the lifter on an instrumented \\nbar while performing a bench press.  \\n \\n \\n \\n100\\nIn both the maximal and submaximal lifts, lateral force was applied to the bar and it \\naveraged between 22 and 29% of the vertical force.  The profile of the lateral force \\ntended to be similar to the profile of the vertical force.  The absolute vertical and lateral \\nforces were greater for the maximal lift than for the submaximal lift, but were not \\ndifferent when compared as a percentage of the load lifted.  Thus, a substantial portion of \\nthe force generated by the lifter is applied along the long axis of the bar.   \\n \\nAim 3:  To determine how an increase in grip width alters the relative muscular activity \\nand the forces, both vertical and along the bar, during the bench press.  \\n \\nBoth the vertical and lateral forces applied to the bar decreased as grip width increased.  \\nNeither peak nor mean electromyography (EMG) levels were systematically affected by \\ngrip width.  Higher forces and EMG recordings were observed in the descent rather than \\nthe lift phase.  Both vertical and lateral force increased as grip width narrowed.  Since \\nsubjects could lift the same load while applying smaller forces to the bar, it appears that \\nwider grip width is more efficient for performing the bench press. \\n \\n6.3  Discussion \\nPerformance of the bench press was analyzed under several different conditions.  Novice \\nlifters were recruited and asked to perform a maximal single lift, submaximal lifts \\nperformed in a set to failure, and submaximal single lifts at different grip widths. \\n \\nMultiple Repetition Sets \\nAfter examining the kinematic profile of the bar as subjects progressed through a set to \\nfailure, it became apparent that novice lifters moved the bar differently at the beginning \\nof a set than they do at the end.  The time to lift the bar more than doubled, and there \\nwere concurrent decreases in the peak and mean bar upward velocity.  Furthermore, the \\nlifters tended to have two peaks in the vertical velocity curve in the later repetitions in the \\nset.  This two-peak pattern was similar to what was seen in the maximal effort single lifts.  \\nThe shift to an early peak in vertical velocity seen in these subjects seems to reflect an \\nattempt to enter the “sticking region” with the greatest possible vertical velocity, thereby \\nincreasing the likelihood of completing the lift.  In an apparent effort to reduce the \\n \\n \\n101\\nmoment the bar created at the shoulder joint, the subjects also kept the bar more directly \\nover the shoulder joint in the later repetitions.    \\n \\nMaximal and Submaximal Lifts   \\nDuring the maximal lift, the lifters in this study typically displayed a force profile pattern \\nwhich was very similar to that reported for competitive lifters (Madsen and McLaughlin, \\n1984).  The lateral force profile followed that of the vertical force quite closely in most \\nsubjects.  The magnitude of the lateral force averaged 26% of the vertical force for the \\nmaximal lift while the lateral force applied during the submaximal lift was slightly less, \\naveraging 24% of the vertical force; there were no differences in the lateral force profiles \\nbetween the two conditions.  In both maximal and submaximal lifts, there was a tendency \\nfor a greater relative lateral force at the beginning of the lift phase, followed by a rapid \\ndecrease lasting through the first 15% of the lift.  From that point on, the lateral force \\ntended to increase slightly, about 2% relative to the vertical force, throughout the \\nremainder of the lift. \\n  \\nThere was no statistically significant difference in muscle activation between the \\nmaximal and submaximal conditions, even though the weight lifted and the vertical force \\napplied to the bar in the submaximal trials were 25% less than their counterparts in the \\nmaximal lift.  While it may be that novice lifters were not able to readily modify their \\nmuscle activation patterns to a level that could be detected by the surface EMG methods \\nused in this study when encountering different loads, it is more likely an artifact of the \\nincrease in lifting velocity observed throughout the submaximal lifts. \\n \\nEffects of Grip Width  \\nWhen lifting the same load at different grip widths, the vertical and lateral force \\nincreased significantly as grip width narrowed.  There was also a substantial increase in \\nthe amount of elbow flexion in the narrower grip width conditions.  Moving the hands \\ncloser together, or further inside the elbows, acts to increase the moment the load lifted \\ncreates about the elbow.  It appears that a byproduct of the lifters’ efforts to overcome \\nthis increased moment is an increase in both vertical and lateral force.  The increase in \\n \\n \\n102\\nforce required to lift the load, as well as a 25% increase in distance the bar has to be \\nlifted, clarifies why maximal lift performance decreases when grip narrows. \\n \\nWithin repetitions, there were differences in muscular activation level between the \\ndescent and lift phases; the pectoralis is highly activated when slowing the descent of the \\nbar, and the triceps is most active during the lifting phase.  There was little or no \\nstatistically significant change in muscle activation across grip widths.  This contradicts \\nthe theory that pectoralis involvement tends to decrease and triceps involvement \\nincreases with a narrower grip (Madsen and McLaughlin, 1984).  \\n \\nTraining Applications \\nThe subjects in this research project have displayed some definite trends that have \\npractical implications for the development of training programs for novice lifters.  \\nLooking at their lifting kinematics, it is immediately apparent that, not only do novice \\nlifters move the bar with a different kinematic pattern than expert lifters, they do not \\nmaintain the same movement pattern throughout a set to failure.  It has been established \\nthat strength gains are influenced by the position used in training in isometric (Kitai and \\nSale, 1989) and or range of motion used in training isokinetic exercise (Graves, Pollock, \\nJones, Colvin, and Leggett, 1989).  More recently, Massey, Vincent, Maneval, and \\nJohnson (2005) found that the range of motion used in training also influences strength \\ngains in the bench press.  More specifically, their novice subjects who trained with a \\npartial range of motion showed significantly less strength gain than those who trained \\nwith a full range of motion.  Therefore, novice lifters may benefit (i.e. improve more \\nrapidly) by performing their training lifts at a similar velocity and with a similar \\nkinematic pattern as their 1-RM lifts. \\n \\n6.4  Study Limitations \\nThe first main limitation of this study was the number of subjects used throughout this \\nresearch project.  The number of subjects who completed each proportion of data \\ncollection did not always allow for analysis of sub-groups based upon different \\ncharacteristics like sex or lifting ability.   \\n \\n \\n \\n103\\nSecondly, the design of the bar may have influenced some of the results of the study.  To \\nallow for recording of both vertical and lateral forces, the sleeve that was built around the \\nbar and housed the force transducers altered the height of the hands at the bottom of the \\nlift.  When the plates that held the horizontal transducers touched the chest, the bar and \\nthe subjects’ hands were about 2cm above the chest.  In the future, lateral forces could be \\ndetermined using strain gages mounted on a standard bar. \\n \\nFinally, joint kinetics were not examined in this research project.  Determining joint \\nmoments in particular would provide better insight into the relative contributions of \\ndifferent muscles toward completing the bench press under different lifting conditions. \\n  \\n6.5  Directions for Future Research \\nThis research project has shown the kinematic, kinetic, and EMG patterns in novice \\nlifters performing the bench press in several different conditions.  Three promising \\ndirections for future research are apparent.  First, a larger novice population should be \\nrecruited.  This would provide an opportunity to examine joint kinetics as well as allow \\nfor subgroup analyses based on sex or lifting ability throughout all lifting conditions.   \\nSecond, a study should be performed to simultaneously examine the kinetics, kinematics, \\nand muscle activation patterns of elite lifters performing both maximal and submaximal \\nlifts.  There is currently no description of the lateral forces that elite lifters apply to the \\nbar and it is possible that competitive lifting technique has evolved in the two decades \\nsince most of the existing data were recorded.  Establishing (or re-establishing) this \\ninformation for elite lifters would create a better standard for comparison and reveal how \\ntoday’s novice lifters differ from today’s elite lifters.  Once this is accomplished, \\nlongitudinal studies could then be performed to determine what training strategies result \\nin the most rapid improvement in novice lifters.    \\n \\n \\n6.6  Conclusions  \\nThere has been a lack of research describing how novice lifters perform the bench press.  \\nThis research project has clarified the kinetics, kinematics, and EMG patterns of novice \\nlifters as they perform the bench press under different conditions.  The key findings of \\n \\n \\n104\\nthis project show that novice lifters lift the bar more rapidly and through a different path \\nin submaximal lifts than in maximal lifts; they alter the path of the lift as they progress \\nthrough a set to failure and do not modify muscle activation levels in response to \\ndifferent grip widths.  This project has also shown that novice lifters apply force both \\nvertically and outward along the bar when performing the bench press.  The profile of the \\nlateral force is similar to, and averages about 25% of, the vertical force.  Finally, novice \\nlifters reduce the vertical and lateral forces applied to the bar when lifting with wider grip \\npositions, indicating that a wider grip width is more efficient for performing the bench \\npress.   \\n \\n \\n \\n105\\nReferences \\n \\nGraves JE, Pollock ML, Jones AE, Colvin AB, Leggett SH.

To \\naccomplish this, an instrumented bar was designed.  The key components of the bar \\nincluded three horizontal and two vertical force transducers that were mounted to a sleeve \\nthat the lifters would grip during the exercise. \\n \\nTwo, 1.75 inch (4.45cm) outside diameter, steel sleeves were cut to slightly less than one \\nhalf of the length of the grip portion of a standard weight lifting straight bar.  A hole, \\nequal in diameter to the opening of these steel sleeves, was cut into each of two, 3/8 inch \\nthick steel plates.  One of the steel plates was welded onto one end of each of the sleeves \\nso that the opening in the sleeve was aligned with the hole in the plate.  This was done so \\nthat the bar could be placed inside the sleeve and plate.   Three force transducers (PCB \\n208B03, range ± 2200N) were mounted onto the face of one of the plates and then the \\nother, so that the transducers connected to two plates.  Effectively, the plates created a \\nsandwich around the three force transducers (Figure A.1) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBAR \\nBRIDGE \\nFigure A.1.  A schematic of the instrumented bar designed for this study.  The two \\nvertical plates are connected via three horizontally-mounted force transducers.  The \\ngrip portion of the regular bar runs through the two sleeves and is suspended in place \\nby a vertically-mounted force transducer at each end.  A small “bridge” was built \\nthat extended up and past the end of the sleeve so that the transducer could be \\nmounted in a straight, vertical line.  The figure is not to scale. \\n \\n \\n114\\nA bridge was designed and attached to the other end of the each sleeve.  To the end of the \\nbridge, a transducer was suspended.  The lifting bar was slid through the sleeves and then \\nattached to the free end of each force transducer, thereby suspending the lifting bar inside \\nthe sleeve. \\n \\nThe only physical attachment between sleeve and bar was through the vertical force \\ntransducers at either ends of the sleeves.  When used, the lifter would grip and push on \\nthe sleeve and the bar and weights would be lifted via its suspended connections to the \\ntwo vertical transducers.  Because the bar and weights were suspended only by the \\nconnection at the transducers, all of the vertical force (FV) used to lift the bar would be \\napplied through the transducers and could be recorded.  The horizontal force applied in \\ntension and compression along the long axis of the bar (FH) resulting from the force \\napplied by the lifter to the sleeve or the bending moment created by the mass of the bar \\nand added weights (FL) were registered by the force transducers mounted between the \\ntwo steel plates.  See Figure A.2. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFH \\nFL \\nFL \\nFH \\nFV \\nFV \\nFigure A.2.  A representative free body diagram of the bar and the forces acting on and across it.  \\nFL is the force applied by the lifter (one for each arm), FV is the force of the bar and the weights \\nloaded onto each end, and FH is the horizontal force acting along the long axis of the bar.   \\n \\n \\n115\\n \\nA.2  Calculating forces \\nThe following names were assigned to the force transducers (See figure A.3) \\nVL \\n=  Left vertical transducer \\nVR \\n=  Right vertical transducer \\nT \\n=  Top horizontal force transducer \\nBF  \\n=  Front bottom horizontal force transducer \\nBB  \\n=  Back bottom horizontal force transducer \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTo determine vertical force and horizontal force applied along the bar, the following \\nequations were used: \\n \\nVertical force = VL + VR \\nHorizontal force = 1.5 y (T + (0.5 y (BF + BB))) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBF\\nT \\nVR \\nBB\\n VL \\nFigure A.3.  Illustration of the locations of the various transducers.  In this view the two \\nbottom transducers are located immediately in front and back of each other.  While the \\nillustration is not to scale, the distance from the center of the bar to T was double that of \\nvertical distance to BF and BB. \\n \\n \\n116\\nA.3  System Calibration \\nPrior to use in this study, calibration data was taken for the force transducers.  The \\nmanufacturer included values for converting voltage into Newtons.  To determine the \\naccuracy of these conversion values, each transducer was subjected to several static \\nforces applied by a known mass.  The manufacturer supplied conversion for each \\ntransducer proved to be highly accurate, within ±1N of expected value.  Later, once the \\ntransducers were mounted within the modified lifting bar, loads with known mass up to \\n400N were added to the bar, the bar was suspended so that the loads were supported \\nthrough the vertically mounted transducers, and force recording were compared to \\nexpected values based on the mass of the system.  Errors were less than ± 2N.  Then, drift \\nin the transducers was tested during a 5 minute data collection period.  During this \\nperiod, the same 400N load was applied.  Force readings at the end of the 5 minute period \\nremained within ± 2N of the original values.  This amount of time was chosen because it \\nwell exceeded the time any single lifting trial would take.  This amount of drift was \\nconsidered negligible for this study.  Nonlinearity of the transducers, as provided by the \\nmanufacturer, was less than 1% full scale.  Following these calibration efforts, data \\ncollection with human subjects commenced.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n117\\nAPPENDIX B \\n \\nINFORMED CONSENT FORM FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY \\nThe Pennsylvania State University \\n \\n \\n \\nTitle of Project: Force control in varied muscular tasks \\n \\nPrincipal Investigators: Vladimir M. Zatsiorsky, John H. Challis, Michael J. Duffey \\n \\nContact:  \\nJohn H. Challis \\n \\n \\n30 Recreation Building \\n \\n \\nUniversity Park, PA 16802 \\n \\n \\n(814) 865-3445 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis is to certify that I, ______________________________, have been given \\nthe following information with respect to my participation as a volunteer in a \\nprogram of investigation under the supervision of Michael Duffey, M.S. & Drs. \\nVladimir M. Zatsiorsky and John H. Challis. \\n \\n \\n \\n1.  Purpose of the study: \\nAppropriate control of muscles and their force production is essential for any \\nhuman movement.  In this project, we will compare the magnitude and direction \\nof force produced with the desired magnitude and direction.  Performance may be \\nrelated to skeletal architecture, experience, strength, and age.  We will explore the \\nrole of all of these. \\n \\n \\n \\n2.  Procedures to be followed: \\nSubjects will be asked to perform certain muscular tasks.  They include: \\n1.  Submaximal body-weight push ups \\n2.  Submaximal and maximal free-weight bench press \\n3.  Submaximal and maximal hand and finger gripping \\n4.  Maximal gripping combined with elbow flexion or extension \\n5.  Submaximal and maximal isokinetic knee flexion and extension \\nThe forces produced in each of the tasks will be recorded through force plates or \\nforce transducers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n118\\n3.  Discomforts and risks: \\nThere are minimal risks associated with participation in this experiment for \\nhealthy people (those people with no history of traumas to, or neuropathies of the \\nupper limbs).  Force generation above a certain  level can be painful for patients \\nwith hand disorders.  Patients will be asked to generate forces below this level.  \\nSome muscle soreness may be experienced following this type of testing. \\n \\n \\n4.  a.  Benefits to me: \\nSubjects will have the opportunity to learn about various experimental techniques \\nand methods used in biomechanics and motor control research.  In addition, \\npatients will gain a greater understanding of their performance in various strength \\ntraining tasks.    \\n \\n    b.  Potential benefits to society: \\nThe methods developed have potential use as diagnostic tools in clinical and \\npractical settings.  They will enable clinicians to test muscle function and task \\nperformance to identify existing muscular weaknesses, imbalances, and control \\ndeficits and instruct on improved technique. \\n \\n5.  Alternative procedures which could be utilized: \\n \\nN/A \\n \\n6.  Time duration for the procedures and study: \\nEach session will last between one and two hours.  Subjects will participate in one \\nto three sessions. \\n \\n7.
