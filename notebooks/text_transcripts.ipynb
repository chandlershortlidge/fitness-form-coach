Effects of grip width on muscle strength and activation in the\\nlat pull-down. J Strength Cond Res 28(4): 1135–1142, 2014—\\nThe lat pull-down is one of the most popular compound back\\nexercises. Still, it is a general belief that a wider grip activates\\nthe latissimus dorsi more than a narrow one, but without any\\nbroad scientiﬁc support. The aim of the study was to compare\\n6 repetition maximum (6RM) load and electromyographic (EMG)\\nactivity in the lat pull-down using 3 different pronated grip widths.\\nFifteen men performed 6RM in the lat pull-down with narrow,\\nmedium, and wide grips (1, 1.5, and 2 times the biacromial dis-\\ntance) in a randomized and counterbalanced order. The 6RM\\nstrengths with narrow (80.3 6 7.2 kg) and medium grip (80 6\\n7.1 kg) were higher than wide grip (77.3 6 6.3 kg; p = 0.02).\\nThere was similar EMG activation between grip widths for latissi-\\nmus, trapezius, or infraspinatus, but a tendency for biceps brachii\\nactivation to be greater for medium vs. narrow (p = 0.09), when\\nthe entire movement was analyzed. Analyzing the concentric\\nphase separately revealed greater biceps brachii activation using\\nthe medium vs. narrow grip (p = 0.03). In the eccentric phase,\\nthere was greater activation using wide vs. narrow grip for latissi-\\nmus and infraspinatus (p # 0.04), and tendencies for medium\\ngreater than narrow for latissimus, and medium greater than wide\\nfor biceps (both p = 0.08), was observed. Collectively, a medium\\ngrip may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips;\\nhowever, athletes and others engaged in resistance training can\\ngenerally expect similar muscle activation which in turn should\\nresult in similar hypertrophy gains with a grip width that is 1–2\\ntimes the biacromial distance.\\nKEY WORDS\\nEMG, resistance training, biceps brachii,\\nlatissimus dorsi\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA\\nppropriate exercise selection is critical to achieve\\nthe aims of any resistance training program. One\\nof the most popular exercises for the back muscles\\nis the lat pull-down. Being a 2-joint exercise con-\\nsisting of an adduction in the shoulder and a ﬂexion in the\\nelbow, the lat pull-down involves several muscles in the\\nupper body, although it is primarily used to train the latissi-\\nmus dorsi (11). This strength exercise has similarities to\\nmovements in sports such as climbing, different strokes in\\nswimming, and performing the rings in gymnastics (21).\\nThere seems to be a general belief among trainers that a wide\\ngrip activates the latissimus dorsi more than a narrow one;\\nhowever, this relies more on a myth than scientiﬁc research\\n(3). Training regimens based on beliefs instead of scientiﬁc\\nevidence could lead to suboptimal gains.\\nThere have been several studies examining the muscle\\nactivation during different variations of the lat pull-down\\n(8,10,11,21,22,24). However, to our knowledge, only 1 study\\nexamined the differences in muscle activations between dif-\\nferent grip widths in the pronated, anterior pull-down (11),\\nwhich is the most common version of the exercise (3,21).\\nLusk et al. (11) examined muscle activation in the pull-down\\nwith 4 different grip variations; wide and narrow pronated\\nand supinated grip. Two sets of 5 repetitions at 70% of 1\\nrepetition maximum (1RM) were performed with each grip.\\nLusk et al. (11) reported similar muscle activation in latissi-\\nmus dorsi, the middle trapezius, and the biceps brachii\\nbetween\\nwide\\nand\\nnarrow\\npronated\\ngrips.\\nHowever,\\nalthough not entirely comparable, Signorile et al. (21) found\\na higher activation of the latissimus dorsi with a wide ante-\\nrior grip compared with other grips (close grip, supinated\\ngrip, and wide posterior grip) using 10RM-loads.\\nThe effects of pronated grip widths in the anterior lat pull-\\ndown are not yet fully determined: The study by Lusk et al.\\nonly assessed 2 grip widths and had no familiarization session\\nbefore the 1RM test. Also, the participants used the same\\nabsolute rather than relative load in all the different grips, and\\nﬁnally the sets were not performed until or close to failure.\\nThe 2 latter methodological limitations make it difﬁcult to\\ntransfer the ﬁndings to real life training as intensity usually is\\nAddress correspondence to Vidar Andersen, vidar.andersen@hisf.no.\\n28(4)/1135–1142\\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\\n\\x01 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association\\nVOLUME 28 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2014 | 1135\\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\\nprescribed relative to muscular\\nstrength in the trained exercise,\\nand people engaged in resis-\\ntance training usually perform\\nexercises (close) to failure. The\\nimportance of using equal rela-\\ntive loads when comparing dif-\\nferent exercises is emphasized\\nin several recent original studies\\n(17,15,16,19)\\nand\\na\\nrecent\\nreview (5).\\nAs the results of previous\\nstudies are conﬂicting, suffer\\nfrom various methodological\\nlimitations, and have not as-\\nsessed the effects of grip widths\\nfor the lat pull-down as exten-\\nsively as this investigation, the\\naim of the study was to com-\\npare the 6RM load and elec-\\ntromyographic (EMG) activity\\nin the lat-pull down using 3\\ndifferent\\ngrip\\nwidths.\\nOur\\nhypothesis was that using the\\nsame relative load would pro-\\nvide similar muscle activations,\\nbut that the 6RM load would\\ndecrease with increasing grip\\nFigure 1.

The par-\\nticipants took part in 1 session approximately 1 week before\\nthe experimental test to familiarize the participants with the\\nprocedures and identify the 6RM load for the different grip\\nwidths. The exercise test order was randomized and coun-\\nterbalanced for each participant and was identical in the\\nhabituation and experimental tests. To simulate a set in a typ-\\nical workout, the participants performed a 6RM test (1,4,9),\\nwhich corresponds to approximately 85% of 1RM (3) and is\\na recommended intensity for increasing muscle strength and\\nhypertrophy (2,14). By using equal relative load for each\\nexercise with heavy loads performed to volitional failure,\\nwe can assess the practical signiﬁcance of how the indepen-\\ndent variable, grip width, affects the dependent variable,\\nmuscle activation. This is important knowledge for athletes\\nand coaches.\\nSubjects\\nSixteen healthy (age, 24 6 4 years; body mass, 81 6 8 kg;\\nstature, 180 6 1 cm; and BAD, 34.6 6 2.2 cm) resistance-\\ntrained (experience, 6 6 3 years) men volunteered for the\\nstudy. Exclusion criteria were musculoskeletal pain, unfamil-\\niarity with the exercise, injury or illness that might reduce\\nmaximal effort, pain during testing or less than 6 months of\\nresistance training experience (11,17). One person dropped\\nout without giving any further reason; so, a total number of\\n15 participants completed the study. The participants were\\ninstructed to refrain from any additional resistance training\\ntargeting the upper body 48 hours before testing. The sub-\\njects were instructed to maintain their normal diet, hydra-\\ntion, and sleeping habits during the experiment. Before the\\nhabituation session, all participants provided informed writ-\\nten consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the regional\\nresearch ethics committee and conformed to the latest revi-\\nsion of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study had approval\\nby the Institutional Review Board, and all appropriate con-\\nsent pursuant to law was obtained before the start of the\\nstudy.\\nExperimental Testing\\nThe habituation and strength testing session took place during\\nthe spring of 2012. First, the BAD was measured. Each\\nparticipant stood up against a whiteboard while the acromion\\nwas palpated at both sides and marked at the whiteboard. The\\nBAD was deﬁned as the distance between the 2 marks (10).\\nAfter a progressive warm-up (13,19), consisting of 10 repeti-\\ntions at estimated 20% of 6RM, 6 repetitions at 50% of approx-\\nimately 6RM, and 4 repetitions at 85% of approximately 6RM,\\nthe 6RM attempts were started. The start load was set at\\napproximately 90–95% of estimated 6RM and increased by\\n2.5 or 5 kg until 6RM was achieved (2–4 attempts).\\nOne week later, the experimental testing took place. The\\ntesting time of the day was at the convenience of the\\nparticipants,\\nbut\\nalways\\nbetween 10 AM. and 6 PM. The\\nwarm-up was conducted\\nas\\ndescribed above. Next, 6RM\\nof each of the 3 exercises was\\nperformed\\nin a randomized\\nand counterbalanced manner\\nwith concomitant recordings\\nof\\nEMG,\\nbar\\ndisplacement,\\nand\\nangle\\nmovements\\n(described below). Each repeti-\\ntion started with the arms was\\nfully extended and was com-\\nplete when the bar was below\\nthe chin (Figures 2A, B). Three\\nto 5 minutes of rest was given\\nbetween each attempt (6,20).\\nIn the case of an unsuccessful\\nseries, the load was slightly\\nreduced, or longer rest periods\\nwere given. The participants\\nhad to retract their scapulas\\nand\\nwere\\ninstructed\\nto minimize the movement of\\nFigure 4.

In the beginning of the lift, when the\\narms were straight, no movement of the truncus was al-\\nlowed. In the end of the concentric phase, as the bar ap-\\nproached the chin, a minor movement in the hip was\\naccepted, so that participants would be able to perform the\\nexercise in the way they were used to. To control the move-\\nment in the hip, a twin-axis goniometer (SS21L; Biopac\\nSystem, Inc., Goletta, CA, USA) was placed along the femur\\nand truncus. The accuracy of the goniometer was 628 mea-\\nsured over 908. The participants were instructed to lift in\\na controlled and moderate tempo, but were not allowed to\\nshorten the lifting distance by lifting their chin (Figure 2B).\\nA linear encoder (Ergotest Technology AS, Langesund,\\nNorway, sampling frequency of 100 Hz) was used to control\\nthe lifting time and identify the beginning and end of the\\nconcentric and eccentric lifting phases. The linear encoder\\nand the goniometer were synchronized with the EMG\\nrecording system (MuscleLab 4020e; Ergotest Technology\\nAS). To analyze the vertical position, lifting time, and hip\\nangle, a commercial software (MuscleLab V8.13; Ergotest\\nTechnology AS) was used.\\nElectromyographic Measurements\\nThe skin was prepared (shaved, washed with alcohol, and\\nabraded) for the placement of gel coated self-adhesive\\nelectrodes (Dri-Stick Silver circular sEMG Electrodes AE-\\n131; NeuroDyne Medical, Cambridge, MA, USA) before the\\nexperimental tests (11,21). The electrodes (11-mm contact\\ndiameter) were placed along the presumed direction of the\\nunderlying muscle ﬁbre with center-to-center distance of\\n2 cm on the 4 muscles (biceps brachii, trapezius, latissimus\\ndorsi, and infraspinatus) according to the recommendations\\nby SENIAM (7). The electrodes were placed on the domi-\\nnant side of the participants (17,18).\\nTo minimize noise induced from external sources through\\nthe signal cables, the raw EMG signal was ampliﬁed and\\nﬁltered using a preampliﬁer located as near the pickup point\\nas possible. The preampliﬁer had a common mode rejection\\nratio of 100 dB. The raw EMG signal was then band-pass\\nﬁltered (fourth-order Butterworth ﬁlter) 8–600 Hz. The ﬁl-\\ntered EMG signals were converted to root mean square\\n(RMS) signals using a hardware circuit network (frequency\\nresponse 0–600 kHz, averaging constant 100 ms, total\\nerror 60.5%). Finally, the RMS converted signal was sam-\\npled at 100 Hz using a 16-bit A/D converter (AD637).\\nA commercial software (MuscleLab V8.13; Ergotest Tech-\\nnology AS) was used to analyze the stored EMG data. The\\nmean of each concentric, eccentric, and entire repetition of\\nthe ﬁrst to sixth repetitions was used to calculate the RMS\\nEMG. All EMG data were normalized to the best (highest\\nEMG activity) of 2 isometric maximal voluntary contrac-\\ntions (MVCs) before the experimental test. The MVCs were\\nperformed with the medium grip at 908 angle in the elbow\\njoint with 60-second rest between the attempts. Each MVC\\nlasted for 3 seconds (10,12).\\nTABLE 1.

When\\ndifferences were detected by ANOVA, paired t-test with\\nBonferroni post hoc corrections were applied to determine\\nwhere the differences lay. Differences in load, lifting time,\\nand hip angle were assessed with 1-way repeated-measures\\nANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc corrections for multiple\\ngroup comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed\\nwith SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\\nAll results were presented as means 6 SDs and Cohen’s\\nd effect size (ES). An ES of 0.2 was considered small,\\n0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large. Statistical signiﬁcance was\\naccepted at p # 0.05.\\nRESULTS\\nComparing the EMG activity of the whole movement of the\\n6 repetitions (concentric and eccentric phases) revealed\\nsimilar muscle activation of all muscles for the 3 grips (p =\\n0.092–0.96) (Figure 3A). Still, a tendency toward greater\\nactivation of the biceps brachii was observed using medium\\ncompared with narrow grip (61 6 12% vs. 56 6 10%; p =\\n0.092; ES = 0.38).\\nIn the concentric phase, activation of biceps was greater\\nusing medium compared with narrow grip (87 6 17% vs.\\n81 6 14%; p = 0.03; ES = 0.44) (Figure 3B). No other\\nsigniﬁcant differences were observed.\\nIn the eccentric phase, latissimus dorsi and infraspinatus\\nhad greater EMG activity using wide compared with narrow\\ngrip (57 6 14% vs. 54 6 13%; p = 0.04; ES = 0.14 and 91 6\\n48% vs. 89 6 46%; p = 0.02; ES = 0.07). There was a ten-\\ndency toward greater EMG activation of the biceps brachii\\nusing medium compared with wide grip (31 6 17% vs. 28 6\\n15%; p = 0.08; ES = 0.19). Furthermore, latissimus dorsi had\\na tendency toward greater EMG activity using medium\\ncompared with narrow grip (58 6 16% vs. 54 6 13%; p =\\n0.08; ES = 0.18; Figure 3C).\\nThe 6RM load using wide grip was approximately 4%\\nlower than medium grip (77.3 6 6.3 kg vs. 80.3 6 7.2 kg; p =\\n0.021; ES = 0.44) and approximately 4% lower than narrow\\ngrip (77.3 6 6.3 kg vs. 80.0 6 7.1 kg; p = 0.02; ES = 0.4;\\nFigure 4). There were similar loads using narrow and\\nmedium grip widths (80.0 6 7.1 kg vs. 80.3 6 7.2 kg;\\np = 1.00).\\nThere were similar lifting times (p = 0.75) and hip angle\\n(p = 0.84) for the different grips during the tests (Table 1).\\nDISCUSSION\\nGenerally, similar muscle activation was obtained with\\nnarrow, medium, and wide pronated grips in the anterior\\nlat pull-down. However, a medium grip may have some-\\nminor advantages over small and wide grips as biceps brachii\\nhad greater activity using a medium compared with a narrow\\ngrip in the concentric phase, and there was a tendency for\\nthe same in the entire movement. In the eccentric phase,\\nmedium grip provided either higher or equally high muscle\\nactivation for all muscles. In addition, the 6RM load was\\nlower when using a wide grip compared with medium or\\nnarrow grip.\\nA wider grip reduces the ﬂexion and extension of the\\nelbow and increases the shoulder abduction compared with\\na narrow grip altering the working conditions of the muscles.\\nOne might expect that this would lead to a higher activation\\nof the latissimus dorsi and infraspinatus using a wide grip\\nand biceps brachii using a narrow grip. However, our results\\ndid not support this notion. Rather, they validated the results\\nreported by Lusk et al. (11) who examined 2 different pro-\\nnated grip widths in the anterior lat pull-down. Because\\nthose authors used the same absolute and not relative inten-\\nsity, there was uncertainty about the validity of their conclu-\\nsion. Indeed, our ﬁndings of lower absolute strength with\\na wide grip show the importance of strength assessment\\nacross grip widths.\\nOther notable differences between Lusk et al. and our\\nstudy are that we used heavier loads that also were lifted to\\nfailure (6RM that corresponds to ;85% 1RM) as opposed to\\nperforming only 5 repetitions with 70% of 1RM. Further-\\nmore, we examined 3 pronated grip widths, whereas pre-\\nvious studies have used only 1 (10,21,22) or 2 (11).\\nMoreover, the deﬁnition that Lusk et al. used for the wide\\ngrip was probably more like our medium grip. Hence, we\\nadd to the existing literature by including wider grips than\\nthe previously examined.\\nThe differences found in load lifted between the wide and\\nthe 2 other grips cannot be explained by less muscle\\nactivation. However, biomechanical properties (10) may\\ncontribute to the differences in 6RM load. The lever arm\\nfrom the shoulder joint increases as the grip gets wider,\\nwhich increases the torque, and therefore probably causes\\nthe reduction in loading using the wide grip.\\nIn contrast to the present study and Lusk et al. (11),\\nSignorile et al. (21) reported greater latissimus dorsi activa-\\ntion, both in the concentric and eccentric phases, using\\na wide anterior pronated grip compared with 2 different\\nnarrow grips, with the same relative intensity. The narrow\\ngrips were a semi-supinated grip using a V-bar, and a supi-\\nnated grip with BAD between the hands. The wide grip\\nwas deﬁned as the distance from outside of the closed ﬁst\\nto the seventh cervical vertebra. Because of the differences in\\ngrip deﬁnitions, arm rotation, and lifting to fatigue, it is dif-\\nﬁcult to compare our results with the ﬁndings of Signorile\\net al. (21). However, it is more likely that the differences in\\nmuscle activation in Signorile et al. (21) are a result of arm\\nrotation rather than grip width (11). The higher activation in\\nthe eccentric phase is in line with our results, but we found\\nno differences in the concentric phase, which could be\\nbecause of differences in arm rotation or loading.\\nComparison of Loading and Muscle Activity in Lat Pull-Down\\n1140\\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\\nthe\\nTM\\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\\nSeveral studies have included activation measurements of\\nthe synergist biceps brachii, when investigating the whole\\nmovement using different grip widths in the lat pull-down\\n(11,21,22), but to our knowledge, no one has investigated the\\nconcentric and the eccentric phases separately. One could\\nexpect a higher activation of the biceps brachii with a nar-\\nrower grip because this would increase the ﬂexion of the\\nelbow. On the contrary, we found, in the concentric phase,\\nhigher activation using the medium grip compared with the\\nnarrow grip. In the eccentric phase, there was a tendency of\\nhigher activation with the medium compared with the wide\\ngrip. These results could indicate that when using a pronated\\ngrip, medium width is optimal for activating the biceps bra-\\nchii. When combining the 2 phases, there was still a tendency\\nfor higher activation using medium grip, whereas no differ-\\nences were reported in the earlier studies (10,11,23).\\nIn conclusion, there was no major difference in activation\\nfor latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, or trapezius\\nwhen performing 6RM in the anterior lat pull-down with\\nnarrow, medium, and wide anterior grip widths. However,\\nthe 6RM load lifted was lower using a wide compared with\\na small or medium grip. Still, there was some weak evidence\\nthat a medium grip may have some advantages over narrow\\nor wide grip.\\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\\nThe lat pull-down with pronated grip is a popular back\\nexercise, but there is no consensus on what the optimal grip\\nwidth is. This study suggests that a medium grip may have\\nsome minor advantages over a narrow or wide one;\\nhowever, athletes and others engaged in resistance training\\ncan generally expect similar muscle activation which in turn\\nshould result in relatively similar strength and hypertrophy\\ngains with small to wide grip widths (1–2 times the biacro-\\nmial distance). We observed lower absolute strength with\\na wide grip, probably because of biomechanical factors.\\nHence, if it is considered beneﬁcial to lift as heavy absolute\\nloads as possible, we recommend a narrow or medium grip\\nwidth. The results of this study are highly valid for real world\\ntraining as the resistance trained participants in the study\\nused the same relative intensity in all conditions and lifted\\nheavy loads to failure (6RM). In contrast, previous studies\\nsuffered from methodological weaknesses, such as not\\nmatching intensity between exercises and not using heavy\\nloads or lifting to failure.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would like to thank the participants for their positivity\\nand participation in the study. This study was conducted\\nwithout any funding from companies or manufacturers or\\noutside organizations.\\nREFERENCES\\n1. American College of Sports Medicine Position Stand.

Effects of grip width on muscle strength and activation in the lat pull-down. J Strength Cond Res 28(4): 1135–1142, 2014—The lat pull-down is one of the most popular compound back exercises. Still, it is a general belief that a wider grip activates the latissimus dorsi more than a narrow one, but without any broad scientific support. The aim of the study was to compare 6 repetition maximum (6RM) load and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the lat pull-down using 3 different pronated grip widths. Fifteen men performed 6RM in the lat pull-down with narrow, medium, and wide grips (1, 1.5, and 2 times the biacromial distance) in a randomized and counterbalanced order. The 6RM strengths with narrow (80.3 6 7.2 kg) and medium grip (80 6 7.1 kg) were higher than wide grip (77.3 6 6.3 kg; p = 0.02). There was similar EMG activation between grip widths for latissimus, trapezius, or infraspinatus, but a tendency for biceps brachii activation to be greater for medium vs. narrow (p = 0.09), when the entire movement was analyzed. Analyzing the concentric phase separately revealed greater biceps brachii activation using the medium vs. narrow grip (p = 0.03). In the eccentric phase, there was greater activation using wide vs. narrow grip for latissimus and infraspinatus (p # 0.04), and tendencies for medium greater than narrow for latissimus, and medium greater than wide for biceps (both p = 0.08), was observed. Collectively, a medium grip may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips; however, athletes and others engaged in resistance training can generally expect similar muscle activation which in turn should result in similar hypertrophy gains with a grip width that is 1–2 times the biacromial distance. KEY WORDS EMG, resistance training, biceps brachii, latissimus dorsi INTRODUCTION Appropriate exercise selection is critical to achieve the aims of any resistance training program. One of the most popular exercises for the back muscles is the lat pull-down. Being a 2-joint exercise consisting of an adduction in the shoulder and a flexion in the elbow, the lat pull-down involves several muscles in the upper body, although it is primarily used to train the latissimus dorsi. This strength exercise has similarities to movements in sports such as climbing, different strokes in swimming, and performing the rings in gymnastics. There seems to be a general belief among trainers that a wide grip activates the latissimus dorsi more than a narrow one; however, this relies more on a myth than scientific research. Training regimens based on beliefs instead of scientific evidence could lead to suboptimal gains. There have been several studies examining the muscle activation during different variations of the lat pull-down. However, to our knowledge, only 1 study examined the differences in muscle activations between different grip widths in the pronated, anterior pull-down, which is the most common version of the exercise. Lusk et al. examined muscle activation in the pull-down with 4 different grip variations; wide and narrow pronated and supinated grip. Two sets of 5 repetitions at 70% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) were performed with each grip. Lusk et al. reported similar muscle activation in latissimus dorsi, the middle trapezius, and the biceps brachii between wide and narrow pronated grips. However, although not entirely comparable, Signorile et al. found a higher activation of the latissimus dorsi with a wide anterior grip compared with other grips (close grip, supinated grip, and wide posterior grip) using 10RM-loads. The effects of pronated grip widths in the anterior lat pull-down are not yet fully determined: The study by Lusk et al. only assessed 2 grip widths and had no familiarization session before the 1RM test. Also, the participants used the same absolute rather than relative load in all the different grips, and finally the sets were not performed until or close to failure. The 2 latter methodological limitations make it difficult to transfer the findings to real life training as intensity usually is prescribed relative to muscular strength in the trained exercise, and people engaged in resistance training usually perform exercises (close) to failure. The importance of using equal relative loads when comparing different exercises is emphasized in several recent original studies and a recent review. As the results of previous studies are conflicting, suffer from various methodological limitations, and have not assessed the effects of grip widths for the lat pull-down as extensively as this investigation, the aim of the study was to compare the 6RM load and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the lat-pull down using 3 different grip widths. Our hypothesis was that using the same relative load would provide similar muscle activations, but that the 6RM load would decrease with increasing grip widths because the lever arm increases when the grip becomes wider. METHODS Experimental Approach to the Problem A within-participant repeated-measures design was used to examine the 6RM strength and concomitant EMG activity in anterior lat pull-down using narrow, medium, and wide pronated grip widths, defined as 1, 1.5, and 2 times the biacromial distance (BAD), respectively. The participants took part in 1 session approximately 1 week before the experimental test to familiarize the participants with the procedures and identify the 6RM load for the different grip widths. The exercise test order was randomized and counterbalanced for each participant and was identical in the habituation and experimental tests. To simulate a set in a typical workout, the participants performed a 6RM test, which corresponds to approximately 85% of 1RM and is a recommended intensity for increasing muscle strength and hypertrophy. By using equal relative load for each exercise with heavy loads performed to volitional failure, we can assess the practical significance of how the independent variable, grip width, affects the dependent variable, muscle activation. This is important knowledge for athletes and coaches. Subjects Sixteen healthy (age, 24 6 4 years; body mass, 81 6 8 kg; stature, 180 6 1 cm; and BAD, 34.6 6 2.2 cm) resistance-trained (experience, 6 6 3 years) men volunteered for the study. Exclusion criteria were musculoskeletal pain, unfamiliarity with the exercise, injury or illness that might reduce maximal effort, pain during testing or less than 6 months of resistance training experience. One person dropped out without giving any further reason; so, a total number of 15 participants completed the study. The participants were instructed to refrain from any additional resistance training targeting the upper body 48 hours before testing. The subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet, hydration, and sleeping habits during the experiment. Before the habituation session, all participants provided informed written consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the regional research ethics committee and conformed to the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study had approval by the Institutional Review Board, and all appropriate consent pursuant to law was obtained before the start of the study. Experimental Testing The habituation and strength testing session took place during the spring of 2012. First, the BAD was measured. Each participant stood up against a whiteboard while the acromion was palpated at both sides and marked at the whiteboard. The BAD was defined as the distance between the 2 marks. After a progressive warm-up consisting of 10 repetitions at estimated 20% of 6RM, 6 repetitions at 50% of approximately 6RM, and 4 repetitions at 85% of approximately 6RM, the 6RM attempts were started. The start load was set at approximately 90–95% of estimated 6RM and increased by 2.5 or 5 kg until 6RM was achieved (2–4 attempts). One week later, the experimental testing took place. The testing time of the day was at the convenience of the participants, but always between 10 AM and 6 PM. The warm-up was conducted as described above. Next, 6RM of each of the 3 exercises was performed in a randomized and counterbalanced manner with concomitant recordings of EMG, bar displacement, and angle movements. Each repetition started with the arms was fully extended and was complete when the bar was below the chin. Three to 5 minutes of rest was given between each attempt. In the case of an unsuccessful series, the load was slightly reduced, or longer rest periods were given. The participants had to retract their scapulas and were instructed to minimize the movement of their truncus and hip. In the beginning of the lift, when the arms were straight, no movement of the truncus was allowed. In the end of the concentric phase, as the bar approached the chin, a minor movement in the hip was accepted, so that participants would be able to perform the exercise in the way they were used to. To control the movement in the hip, a twin-axis goniometer was placed along the femur and truncus. The accuracy of the goniometer was 628 measured over 908. The participants were instructed to lift in a controlled and moderate tempo, but were not allowed to shorten the lifting distance by lifting their chin. A linear encoder was used to control the lifting time and identify the beginning and end of the concentric and eccentric lifting phases. The linear encoder and the goniometer were synchronized with the EMG recording system. To analyze the vertical position, lifting time, and hip angle, a commercial software was used. Electromyographic Measurements The skin was prepared (shaved, washed with alcohol, and abraded) for the placement of gel-coated self-adhesive electrodes before the experimental tests. The electrodes (11-mm contact diameter) were placed along the presumed direction of the underlying muscle fiber with center-to-center distance of 2 cm on the 4 muscles (biceps brachii, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and infraspinatus) according to the recommendations by SENIAM. The electrodes were placed on the dominant side of the participants. To minimize noise induced from external sources through the signal cables, the raw EMG signal was amplified and filtered using a preamplifier located as near the pickup point as possible. The preamplifier had a common mode rejection ratio of 100 dB. The raw EMG signal was then band-pass filtered (fourth-order Butterworth filter) 8–600 Hz. The filtered EMG signals were converted to root mean square (RMS) signals using a hardware circuit network. Finally, the RMS converted signal was sampled at 100 Hz using a 16-bit A/D converter. A commercial software was used to analyze the stored EMG data. The mean of each concentric, eccentric, and entire repetition of the first to sixth repetitions was used to calculate the RMS EMG. All EMG data were normalized to the best (highest EMG activity) of 2 isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) before the experimental test. The MVCs were performed with the medium grip at 908 angle in the elbow joint with 60-second rest between the attempts. Each MVC lasted for 3 seconds. Statistical Analyses To analyze the influence of the independent variable (grip width), 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences in the 2 dependent variables (muscle EMG amplitude and 6RM load). When differences were detected by ANOVA, paired t-test with Bonferroni post hoc corrections were applied to determine where the differences lay. Differences in load, lifting time, and hip angle were assessed with 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc corrections for multiple group comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 17.0. All results were presented as means 6 SDs and Cohen’s d effect size (ES). An ES of 0.2 was considered small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large. Statistical significance was accepted at p # 0.05. RESULTS Comparing the EMG activity of the whole movement of the 6 repetitions (concentric and eccentric phases) revealed similar muscle activation of all muscles for the 3 grips (p = 0.092–0.96). Still, a tendency toward greater activation of the biceps brachii was observed using medium compared with narrow grip (61 6 12% vs. 56 6 10%; p = 0.092; ES = 0.38). In the concentric phase, activation of biceps was greater using medium compared with narrow grip (87 6 17% vs. 81 6 14%; p = 0.03; ES = 0.44). No other significant differences were observed. In the eccentric phase, latissimus dorsi and infraspinatus had greater EMG activity using wide compared with narrow grip (57 6 14% vs. 54 6 13%; p = 0.04; ES = 0.14 and 91 6 48% vs. 89 6 46%; p = 0.02; ES = 0.07). There was a tendency toward greater EMG activation of the biceps brachii using medium compared with wide grip (31 6 17% vs. 28 6 15%; p = 0.08; ES = 0.19). Furthermore, latissimus dorsi had a tendency toward greater EMG activity using medium compared with narrow grip (58 6 16% vs. 54 6 13%; p = 0.08; ES = 0.18). The 6RM load using wide grip was approximately 4% lower than medium grip (77.3 6 6.3 kg vs. 80.3 6 7.2 kg; p = 0.021; ES = 0.44) and approximately 4% lower than narrow grip (77.3 6 6.3 kg vs. 80.0 6 7.1 kg; p = 0.02; ES = 0.4). There were similar loads using narrow and medium grip widths (80.0 6 7.1 kg vs. 80.3 6 7.2 kg; p = 1.00). There were similar lifting times (p = 0.75) and hip angle (p = 0.84) for the different grips during the tests. DISCUSSION Generally, similar muscle activation was obtained with narrow, medium, and wide pronated grips in the anterior lat pull-down. However, a medium grip may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips as biceps brachii had greater activity using a medium compared with a narrow grip in the concentric phase, and there was a tendency for the same in the entire movement. In the eccentric phase, medium grip provided either higher or equally high muscle activation for all muscles. In addition, the 6RM load was lower when using a wide grip compared with medium or narrow grip. A wider grip reduces the flexion and extension of the elbow and increases the shoulder abduction compared with a narrow grip altering the working conditions of the muscles. One might expect that this would lead to a higher activation of the latissimus dorsi and infraspinatus using a wide grip and biceps brachii using a narrow grip. However, our results did not support this notion. Rather, they validated the results reported by Lusk et al. who examined 2 different pronated grip widths in the anterior lat pull-down. Because those authors used the same absolute and not relative intensity, there was uncertainty about the validity of their conclusion. Indeed, our findings of lower absolute strength with a wide grip show the importance of strength assessment across grip widths. Other notable differences between Lusk et al. and our study are that we used heavier loads that also were lifted to failure (6RM that corresponds to approximately 85% 1RM) as opposed to performing only 5 repetitions with 70% of 1RM. Furthermore, we examined 3 pronated grip widths, whereas previous studies have used only 1 or 2. Moreover, the definition that Lusk et al. used for the wide grip was probably more like our medium grip. Hence, we add to the existing literature by including wider grips than the previously examined. The differences found in load lifted between the wide and the 2 other grips cannot be explained by less muscle activation. However, biomechanical properties may contribute to the differences in 6RM load. The lever arm from the shoulder joint increases as the grip gets wider, which increases the torque, and therefore probably causes the reduction in loading using the wide grip. In contrast to the present study and Lusk et al., Signorile et al. reported greater latissimus dorsi activation, both in the concentric and eccentric phases, using a wide anterior pronated grip compared with 2 different narrow grips, with the same relative intensity. The narrow grips were a semi-supinated grip using a V-bar, and a supinated grip with BAD between the hands. The wide grip was defined as the distance from outside of the closed fist to the seventh cervical vertebra. Because of the differences in grip definitions, arm rotation, and lifting to fatigue, it is difficult to compare our results with the findings of Signorile et al. However, it is more likely that the differences in muscle activation in Signorile et al. are a result of arm rotation rather than grip width. The higher activation in the eccentric phase is in line with our results, but we found no differences in the concentric phase, which could be because of differences in arm rotation or loading. Several studies have included activation measurements of the synergist biceps brachii when investigating the whole movement using different grip widths in the lat pull-down, but to our knowledge, no one has investigated the concentric and the eccentric phases separately. One could expect a higher activation of the biceps brachii with a narrower grip because this would increase the flexion of the elbow. On the contrary, we found, in the concentric phase, higher activation using the medium grip compared with the narrow grip. In the eccentric phase, there was a tendency of higher activation with the medium compared with the wide grip. These results could indicate that when using a pronated grip, medium width is optimal for activating the biceps brachii. When combining the 2 phases, there was still a tendency for higher activation using medium grip, whereas no differences were reported in the earlier studies. In conclusion, there was no major difference in activation for latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, or trapezius when performing 6RM in the anterior lat pull-down with narrow, medium, and wide anterior grip widths. However, the 6RM load lifted was lower using a wide compared with a small or medium grip. Still, there was some weak evidence that a medium grip may have some advantages over narrow or wide grip. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The lat pull-down with pronated grip is a popular back exercise, but there is no consensus on what the optimal grip width is. This study suggests that a medium grip may have some minor advantages over a narrow or wide one; however, athletes and others engaged in resistance training can generally expect similar muscle activation which in turn should result in relatively similar strength and hypertrophy gains with small to wide grip widths (1–2 times the biacromial distance). We observed lower absolute strength with a wide grip, probably because of biomechanical factors. Hence, if it is considered beneficial to lift as heavy absolute loads as possible, we recommend a narrow or medium grip width. The results of this study are highly valid for real-world training as the resistance-trained participants in the study used the same relative intensity in all conditions and lifted heavy loads to failure (6RM). In contrast, previous studies suffered from methodological weaknesses, such as not matching intensity between exercises and not using heavy loads or lifting to failure.
